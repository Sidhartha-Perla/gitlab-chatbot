### Operations for All
Truly integrated DevOps teams are difficult to create.
While large organizations have the budget to staff dedicated teams with roles like "Cost Optimization Engineer" and "Site Reliability Engineer" smaller teams require "Jack of All Trades" engineers.

Our vision at GitLab is that everyone can contribute, and that small teams, without specialization, can leverage and adopt the same tools as those in larger organizations.
By building on our preference for convention over configuration, we can take the guess work out of operations.
We will enable you and your team to [quickly build a production application](/direction/5-min-production/) and iterate on it. We'll make it easy for teams to utilize modern operations practices, avoiding alert fatigue by detecting real user events enabling them to [resolve like a pro](/direction/monitor#resolve-like-a-pro).
Not just on its features, but on the overall experience delivered to your users. Rapidly.
