### Progressive Delivery and Deployment

Progressive Delivery is a set of emerging Continuous Delivery (CD) best practices, oriented around implementing safety and automation in incrementally deliverying (sometimes without deployment) software changes over time. It takes Continuous Delivery to the next level by providing more options around how and when different users get access to your new features, making software delivery a continuous activity, rather than frequent but punctuated moments in time.
