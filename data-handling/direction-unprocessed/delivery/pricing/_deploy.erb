With respect to environments and deployments, we believe that the core features should be available in the Free ofering of GitLab to support small teams and hobby projects.

At the same time, in most cases professionals require these features in scaled settings where the direct users of the features might be platform engineers, serving software teams.
We think that this model fits best the Premium pricing tier for many of our features.

On top of the Premium features, we want to provide features under the Ultimate tier when they are related to compliace and security reporting.
