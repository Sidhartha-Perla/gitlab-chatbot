### Spinnaker

[Spinnaker](https://spinnaker.io/), born out of Netflix, is an open-source, cloud-native, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform for releasing software changes.

It views its solution in three parts. First, [application management](https://spinnaker.io/concepts/#application-management-aka-infrastructure-management) which enables users to visualize and manage cloud resources. Second, [application deployment](https://spinnaker.io/concepts/#application-deployment) is a powerful and flexible pipeline management system with integrations to the major cloud providers and treats deployments as a first-class citizen. Lastly, [managed delivery](https://spinnaker.io/concepts/#managed-delivery) combines application management and delivery, and enables users to specify what they want in declarative format.

Spinnaker's advantage points are:
* Provides easy application deployment across cloud providers. We have also recognised this as one of our top vision items and are working to [natively support hypercloud deployments](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1804).
* Supports several deployment strategies which we are working on expanding in [Advanced Deploys](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2213).
* Allows configuring an environment in standby for easy rollback, which is closely tied to [gitlab#35409](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35409).
* Provides a user interface that allows you to view your infrastructure and to see exactly where your code is residing.
* Acts as an operator that performs rollback when needed without the need to provide a script to do so (similar to Kubernetes).
* Ability to manage [multiple Kubernetes clusters](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/#multiple-kubernetes-clusters), which is also supported by GitLab.

There is additional analysis that can be found in [gitlab#197709](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/197709#note_274765321) and in [gitlab#35219](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35219).
