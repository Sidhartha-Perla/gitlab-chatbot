### Weaveworks

[Weaveworks](https://www.weave.works/) positions itself as a Kubernetes platform, enabling devops teams to do GitOps, to manage cluster lifecycles, and to monitor applications. Weaveworks operates a SaaS solution that operates the various open source projects it maintains. Of the open source tools, particularly notable in the deployment context is[ Flux](https://www.weave.works/oss/flux/) which enables GitOps,[ Flagger](https://www.weave.works/oss/flagger/) which enables canary deployments.[ Scope](https://www.weave.works/oss/scope/) which enables visualization of Kubernetes, and[ Cortex](https://www.weave.works/oss/cortex/) which enables monitoring.

We decided to integrate Flux into the GitLab offering. We think of Weaveworks as a partner and are looking for possibilities to best serve our shared customers.
