### Argo

[Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) is part of the [Argo Project](https://argoproj.github.io/) which is a incubation project in CNCF. Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD is installed as an application in its own namespace in a cluster. Optionally, you can also register additional clusters to do multi-cluster deployments.

Beyond enabling users to practice GitOps, Argo CD does a great job reporting and visualizing the differences between your target state and live state, which greatly facilitates learning and understanding for operators.

Combined together with the other Argo Project capabilities, including Workflow, Rollouts, and Events, using Argo is a fairly complete way to manage the entire Kubernetes Development lifecycle.
