### Strategy and Themes

[Using DORA metrics](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/value-stream-management/dora/), Gitlab accelerates engineering work in the context of end-to-end value delivery.

DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics have become widely recognized and adopted as industry standards for measuring DevOps performance. Software leaders find DORA metrics very useful for measuring the outcome of DevOps because they provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and impact of their DevOps practices. DORA metrics are derived from extensive research conducted by the [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html) team, which has identified a set of key metrics that correlate with high-performing software delivery and operational excellence.

The DORA team, has created a list of [four metrics that are straightforward, focused, and easy to implement](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance). They form an excellent foundation for data-driven initiatives, helping improve existing DevSecOps efficiency while also building a bridge to business stakeholders.

These four "DORA" metrics are:

- [Deployment Frequency](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/dora_metrics.html#deployment-frequency)
- [Lead time for changes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/dora_metrics.html#lead-time-for-changes)
- [Time to restore service](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/dora_metrics.html#time-to-restore-service)
- [Change Failure Rate](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/dora_metrics.html#change-failure-rate).

#### DORA and Value Stream Management:

DORA metrics are available in GitLab [Value Streams Dashboard](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/value_streams_dashboard.htm), [Insights reports](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/insights/#dora-query-parameters) and in the [CI/CD analytics reports](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/ci_cd_analytics.html#view-deployment-frequency-chart). [APIs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/dora/metrics.html) are also available for all four DORA metrics. In GitLab, DORA metrics are embedded as part of the [Value stream management end-to-end DevOps analytics framework](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/plan/value_stream_management/#value-stream-management-as-the-framework-for-end-to-end-devops-analytics). With DORA Metrics, Gitlab's VSM is visualized the work in the context of the value stream - measuring the velocity and stability of software delivery lifecycle through the [DORA4 metrics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/#devops-research-and-assessment-dora-key-metrics). 

The following video provides a brief overview of Gitlab's DORA metrics:

The DORA metrics are not intended to be a one-size-fits-all solution but rather provide a set of key metrics that organizations can use as a starting point to assess their DevOps performance. While there may be variations and adaptations of these metrics based on specific organizational contexts, the core principles and concepts outlined by DORA have had a significant impact on the DevOps community and are widely regarded as industry standards for measuring DevOps success.
