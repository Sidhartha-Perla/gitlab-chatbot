- **[Cumulative flow diagrams](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/7629)**
  - _Outcome:_ Teams have an additional sensing mechanism to diagnose overloaded queues so they can better diagnose and improve process stability. This is currently blocked by the implementation of [configurable work item statuses](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5099)
- **[Capacity planning and management](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1686)**
  - _Outcome:_ When planning work within timeboxes, the team can take the variable of team capacity into account when decided how much scope to take on for a given period. 
- **[Integrating analytics on Issue Boards](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1956)**
  - _Outcome:_ Teams can access burndown charts and cumulative flow diagrams specific to their team and directly within the context where they are planning and visualizing the flow of their work items.
