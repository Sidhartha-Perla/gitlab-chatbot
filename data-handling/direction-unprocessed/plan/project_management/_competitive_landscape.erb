The [project management tools market](https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/project-management) is dominated by Jira (31%), Microsoft (18%), Smartsheet (6%), and Trello (5%). To be competitive, GitLab needs to solve for the following customer comments in the immediate future:

> We’ve been told to use gitlab’s milestones to capture agile sprints, as they’re the only thing that can have burn down, they work well with boards and have concepts of time.  The default way epics get their start/end dates is based on the milestones of the issues attached though – doesn’t make sense as an issue shouldn’t be assigned to an agile sprint until the sprint is eminent.  (root of problem is that gitlab milestone must either be equated to agile milestone or agile sprint, not both – you’re missing a concept)
>
> Needs to be a way to have a team velocity, as a scrum master be able to go through and say “This feature requires ~100 points of work, we can do 25 points per sprint, will take 4 sprints (8 weeks) – you want it done in 6 weeks, will either require to be simplified or increased resourcing.”
>
> Need burn-down chart/progress status of sprints, features, initiatives, and milestones.
>
> During sprint planning, need a way to see what my team’s velocity has been last several sprints to have a good idea of how much we should be planning for upcoming sprint.
>
> Need an easy way to see how much I’m assigning to each team member during sprint planning (team members aren’t interchangeable – sprint can have user stories less than velocity, but if user stories are only doable by one team member then the work can’t get done).
>
> Need to be able to answer questions around “which teams/members are working on this feature?”, “are we still on track to meet this milestone?”, “we want to add this new feature, how will that slow down other development?”, “This team is needed for another project, how will that effect timelines on this project?”, etc...
