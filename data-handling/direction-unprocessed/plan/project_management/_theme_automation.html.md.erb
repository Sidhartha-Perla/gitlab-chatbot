- **[Automation Framework](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/218)**
  - _Outcome:_ Teams can create automation sequences for transitioning issues to different statuses, updating meta data based on given events, and self-serve creating solutions to help improve efficiencies around Issue management.
- **[Configurable Workflows](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/2059)**
  - _Outcome:_ Teams can sequence types of issues through different workflows / statuses. For those compliance minded organizations, workflows will optionally support [tollgates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/273760#note_439052044).
