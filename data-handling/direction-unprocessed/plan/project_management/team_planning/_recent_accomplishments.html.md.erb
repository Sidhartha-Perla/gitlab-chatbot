- **[Adds type attribute to issues webhook payloads (17.1)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/467415)** -- Issues, tasks, incidents, requirements, objectives, and key results all trigger payloads under the Issues Events webhook category. Until now, there has been no way to quickly determine the type of object that triggered the webhook within the event payload. This release introduces an object_attributes.type attribute available on payloads within the Issues events, Comments, Confidential issues events, and Emoji events triggers.
