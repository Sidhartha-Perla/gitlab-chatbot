- **[Group issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/12320)**. Issues can be created within groups without depending on a project within the group. This will optionally allow teams to consolidate their planning workflows within a single location instead of spreading them across a group and a project.  
- **[Work items open in a drawer within boards and lists](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/387224)**. Reduce the context switching and tab fatique when drilling down into a work item detail view. 
- **[Customizable work item statuses](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368290)**. Provide a foundation for building a more robust work item lifecycle management solution, and enable teams to mark work items as done or cancelled. 
- **[Report on iteration velocity and volatility](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/435)** -- Helps teams have meaningful discussions about trade-offs and estimations when planning upcoming iterations. Issues and tasks can be assigned to iterations, so our next step is [showing parent/child relationships in the iteration report](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/457538), followed by [displaying velocity and volatility](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/457094). 
- **[Work items are natively supported within Groups](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8308)** -- Eliminate the need to maintain projects under groups solely for agile planning purposes, allow teams to consolidate their planning activities at the group level, and enable issues and epics to be migrated to work items. We're currently working on [the remaining blockers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/458986) to feature parity between legacy issues and work item issues. Once issues are migrated to work items, we will be able to turn on native Group Issues.
