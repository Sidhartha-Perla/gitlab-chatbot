- **Surface additional AI Impact Analytics metrics to help customers better understand the impact and ROI for using GitLab Duo Pro and Duo Enterpise** -- In addition to metrics for code suggestions and chat, we will provide insight into productivity gains from:
  - Adoption of [pipeline root cause analysis](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/15025).
  - Adoption of [vulnerability explanation/resolution](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/15024).
  - Adding [AI vs. Non-AI Cohort Analysis](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/15906).
  - Adding insight into ["language usage" of Code Suggestions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/454809). 
  - Working on an update [UX vision for AI adoption dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/505532). 
- Mature [Value Streams Dashboard for Executives](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9317) to enable decision-makers to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for digital transformation improvements.In the next 1-3 milestones, we will focus on the following: 
  - [Consolidate Group::Optimize dashboards](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/13801) into the [Cross-stage Dashboards framework](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/13801). With the new framework, customers can visualize their DevSecOps data using built-in dashboards provided by GitLab or by creating custom dashboards with custom visualizations.
  - [Customizable widgets](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8925) to show data that is relevant to user's goals and needs. Adding the ["Platform Insights" customizable UI capabilities](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8925). Integrate the Value streams dashboard page into the [Platform Insights schema driven UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/analytics_dashboards.html).
- Adding [VSA settings](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9129) with label filters configuration. In a similar way to boards, teams want to use saved filtered labels with value streams.
