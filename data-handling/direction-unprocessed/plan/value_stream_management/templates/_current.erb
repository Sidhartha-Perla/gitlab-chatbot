* Improved ["AI Impact" analytics to the Value Stream Dashboard](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/12978#roadmap), to provide more holistic view of the ROI from the investments in AI features. We're currently focusing on adding [per-user metrics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/15026), making [basic AI Impact Analytics available for Duo Pro customers via the GraphQL API](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/498497), and making [iterative improvements to the data visualization and user experience on the AI Impact Analytics dashboard](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/15030).
* **[Enhanced configuration for custom value stream analytics reports](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9129)** - With this change, custom VSA report stage configuration moves from a modal to a standalone page and adds support for persistent filters that apply to all items included in the custom VSA report.
