- New event into Value Stream Analytics (VSA) was added - "Merge request last approved at" to improve development workflow tracking. This enhancing workflow visibility with [new insights into merge request review time](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/02/20/gitlab-17-9-released/#enhancing-workflow-visibility-new-insights-into-merge-request-review-time).
- New [API with code suggestion usage events (17.5)](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/10/17/gitlab-17-5-released/#export-code-suggestion-usage-events). Thjis API provide the raw event data and designed for customers without ClickHouse to gain insights into AI usage.
- **[Value Stream Management report generator tool (17.1)](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/06/20/gitlab-17-1-released/#new-value-stream-management-report-generator-tool)** -- With the addition of the new Reports Generation Tool for Value Stream Management, we empower decision-makers to be more efficient and effective in the software development life cycle (SDLC) optimization. You can now schedule [DevSecOps comparison metrics reports](https://gitlab.com/components/vsd-reports-generator#example-for-monthly-executive-value-streams-report) or the [AI Impact analytics report](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/05/16/gitlab-17-0-released/#ai-impact-analytics-in-the-value-streams-dashboard) to be delivered automatically, proactively, and with relevant information in GitLab issues. With scheduled reports, managers can focus on analyzing insights and making informed decisions, rather than spending time manually searching for the right dashboard with the required data. You can access the scheduled reports tool using the [CI/CD Catalog](https://gitlab.com/explore/catalog).
- **[Adding a new event "MR first reviewer assigned" (17.2)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/466383)** -- To improve the tracking of development workflows in GitLab, we added the Value Stream Analytics has been extended with a new stage event: "MR first reviewer assigned".
- **[AI Impact analytics: Code Suggestions acceptance rate and GitLab Duo seats usage (17.3)](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/08/15/gitlab-17-3-released/#ai-impact-analytics-code-suggestions-acceptance-rate-and-gitlab-duo-seats-usage) -- These two new metrics highlight the effectiveness and utilization of GitLab Duo, and are now included in the AI Impact analytics in the Value Streams Dashboard, which helps organizations understand the impact of GitLab Duo on delivering business value.
- **[AI Impact analytics with enhanced sparklines trend visualization (17.3)](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/08/15/gitlab-17-3-released/#ai-impact-analytics-with-enhanced-sparklines-trend-visualization)** -- We are excited to announce a significant improvement to our AI Impact analytics with the introduction of sparklines. These small, simple graphs embedded in data tables enhance the readability and accessibility of AI Impact data. By transforming numerical values into visual representations, the new sparklines make it easier to identify trends over time, so you can spot upward or downward movements. This new visual approach also streamlines the process of comparing trends across multiple metrics, reducing the time and effort required when relying solely on numbers.
- **[New Value Stream Analytics stage events for Cycle Time Reduction (17.3)](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/08/15/gitlab-17-3-released/#new-value-stream-analytics-stage-events-for-cycle-time-reduction)** -- To improve the tracking of merge request (MR) review time in GitLab, we added a new stage event to Value Stream Analytics: MR first reviewer assigned. With this new event teams can identify where delays occur in the review process, find opportunities to improve collaboration, and encourage a culture of responsiveness and accountability among team members. Reducing the review time directly impacts the overall cycle time of development, leading to faster software delivery. For example, you can now add a new custom Review Time to Merge (RTTM) stage that starts with MR first reviewer assigned and ends with MR merged.
- **[Export code suggestions usage events (17.5)](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/10/17/gitlab-17-5-released/#export-code-suggestion-usage-events)** -- Previously, AI impact analytics were available only on GitLab.com to GitLab Duo Enterprise customers, and on GitLab self-managed with a ClickHouse integration. Additionally, the default metrics were aggregated. Now, you can export raw code suggestion events from the GraphQL API. This way you can import the data into your data analysis tool to get deeper insights into acceptance rates across more dimensions, such as suggestion size, language, and user. The raw events are not stored in ClickHouse, so some AI Impact Analytics metrics become available to all GitLab deployments, including GitLab Dedicated and self-managed.
