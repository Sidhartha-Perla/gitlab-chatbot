### Competitive Landscape

Top 3 Competitors: 

1. [Tasktop](https://www.tasktop.com/) (acquired by Planview) - Best In Class (BIC) competitor.
2. [Digital.ai](https://digital.ai/)
3. [Plutora Analytics](https://www.plutora.com/platform/plutora-analytics) 

Based on our analysis,  we've identified Planview-Tasktop as the Best In Class (BIC) competitor over Digital.ai and Plutora.

#### Tasktop - Best In Class (BIC) competitor
[Tasktop ](https://www.tasktop.com/integration-hub) is exclusively focused on Value Stream Management and allows users to connect more than 50 tools together, including Atlassian's JIRA, GitLab, GitHub, JamaSoftware, CollabNet VersionOne, Xebia Labs, and TargetProcess to name a few. Tasktop serves as an integration layer on top of all the software development tools that a team uses and allows for mapping of processes and people in order to achieve a common data model across the toolchain. End users can visualize the flows between the different tools and the data can be exported to a database for visualization through BI tools.

Based on our analysis, we've identified these gaps against Tasktop:

#### Digital.ai 

[Digital.ai](https://digital.ai/) AI-Powered DevOps platform.  Digital.ai has been on a multiyear, multiacquisition journey that includes Arxan, CollabNet
VersionOne, Experitest, Numerify, and XebiaLabs. Its plan to be a front-runner in AI-driven software delivery for Global 5000 enterprises.

[XebiaLabs' analytics (acquired by Digital.ai)](https://docs.xebialabs.com/xl-release/concept/release-dashboard-tiles.html) are predominantly focused on the Release Manager and give useful overviews of deployments, issue throughput and stages. The company integrates with JIRA, Jenkins, etc and end users can see in which stage of the release process they are.

#### Plutora
[Plutora Analytics](https://www.plutora.com/platform/plutora-analytics) Plutora is a privately held global software (SaaS) company, providing Value Stream Management solutions for enterprise IT in the areas of Release Management and Orchestration, Test Environment Management, Deployment Management, and Analytics.. Plutora seem to target mainly the release managers with their [Time to Value Dashboard](https://www.plutora.com/platform/time-to-value-dashboard). The company also integrates with JIRA, Jenkins, GitLab, CollabNet VersionOne, etc but there is still a lot of configuration that seems to be left to the user.

Key Features for Comparison:

The ability to create and manage single or multiple value streams as a single source of insight for the organization.This include - users, processes (workflow labels), work items (issues, MRs and epics) and time tracking. 
4. Integrations - Inbound and outbound integrations with 3rd party tools.
5. Value Measurement - Connect software investments to business results. Capture, calculate, and track product usage, OKRs, cost metrics, and business KPIs (Revenue, Renewals).
6. Governance and Compliance - The ability to monitor compliance to organizational standards.
7. AI/ML - Leverages AI/ML for better decision-making. The ability to predict trends, detects blind spots, bobble-up insights, and automate processes to reduce manual tasks.

More competitors in our Landscape:

#### TargetProcess
[Targetprocess](https://www.targetprocess.com) tries to provide a full overview of the delivery process and integrates with Jenkins, GitHub and JIRA. The company also provides customizable dashboards that can give an overview over the process from ideation to delivery.

#### GitPrime
Although [GitPrime](https://www.gitprime.com) doesn't try to provide a value stream management solution, it focuses on productivity metrics and cycle time by looking at the productivity of a team. It exclusively uses only git data.

#### Azure DevOps
Naturally, [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/report/dashboards/analytics-widgets?view=azure-devops) is working on adding analytics that can help engineering teams become more effective but it's still in very early stages. It has also recently acquired [PullPanda](https://pullpanda.com).

#### Velocity by Code Climate
Similarly to GitPrime, [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/velocity/understand-diagnose/) focuses on the team and uses git data only.

#### Gitalytics
Similarly to GitPrime, [Gitalytics](https://gitalytics.com) focuses on the team and uses git data only.

#### Gitential

#### Gitclear

#### Gitlean
[Gitlean](https://gitlean.com)

#### CollabNet VersionOne
[CollabNet VersionOne](https://www.collab.net) provides users with the ability to input a lot of information, which is a double edged sword as it can lead to duplication of effort and stale information when feeds are not automated. It does however, allow a company to visualize project streams from a top level with all their dependencies. End users can also create customizable reports and dashboards that can be shared with senior management.

#### CA Technologies
[CA Agile Central](https://docs.ca.com/en-us/ca-agile-central/saas/iteration-burndown) combines data across the planning process in a single integrated page with custom applications available to CA Agile Central users. The applications can be installed in custom pages within CA Agile Central or on a dashboard.

### Analyst Landscape

[Gartner Market Guide for DevOps Value Stream Delivery Platforms](https://about.gitlab.com/analysts/gartner-vsdp21/). It is also possible to utilize GitLab's Value Stream Management as a [Software Engineering Intelligence Platform](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4214399).

Forrester's New Wave: Value Stream Management Tools, Q3 2018 uncovered an emerging market with no leaders. However, vendors from different niches of the development pipeline are converging to value stream management in response to customers seeking greater transparency into their processes.

Forrester‚Äôs vision for VSM includes:
- end-to-end visibility of the software development process, including the corresponding capture and storage of data, events, and artifacts
- definition and visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs)
- inclusive customer experience, which allows multiple roles (PMs, developers, QA, and release managers) to collaborate in one place
- governance, i.e. a framework to monitor compliance to organizational standards, automated audit capabilities and traceability.

Other Analysts have highlighted that Gitlab data gathering has much to offer and much more to mine and enable the insight generation. We have an immediate opportunity i to extend the insight generation based on the data gathered in the delivery pipelines. Once this is achieved we will integrate additional data sources beyond the DevOps toolchains.

We have the ability to reach the decision makers that are onsuming the insights generated from the Gitlab platform, and one of the key elements here is getting beyond the DORA 4 metrics into those that are more specifically targeted: security, compliance, financial, product, but also enterprise architecture, AI/ML delivery teams and the like.

Additional functionality, requested by clients includes:
- integration with other tools, including the ability to double-click into each tool to directly observe status or take action
- business value custom definitions in terms of financials, time, effort or similar
- mapping of business value, people, processes, data
- visualization dashboards, which users can customize to support different role-based views.
