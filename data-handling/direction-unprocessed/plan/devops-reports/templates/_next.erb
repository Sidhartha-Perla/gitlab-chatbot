   - [Visualizing metrics comparisons](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9559) to help decision-makers understand how different metrics are performing relative to each other or to identify trends and patterns in the data.
   - [Filtering and drill-down](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/383684) into the underline data to get a deeper understanding of specific metrics or trends to identify actionable insights.
   - [Customizable widgets](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8925) to show data that is relevant to user's goals and needs.
