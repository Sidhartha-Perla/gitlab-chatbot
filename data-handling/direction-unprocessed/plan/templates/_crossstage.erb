Plan offers functionality that ties into workflows in other stages.  We are actively collaborating with other stages that are building upon Plan functionality to meet their users needs.

* The Manage:Import and Integrate group has built a Jira integration that displays Jira Issue data within GitLab. We will collaborate with that team to tie Jira Issues into more workflows like reporting and tying Jira Issues to higher level work items.
* The Manage:Import and Integrate owns the [Jira importer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/jira.html) to allow Jira issues to be migrated to GitLab. We will continue to work with that team to extend GitLab work items to accomodate more critical data elements from Jira to ensure a seamless import process.
* The Plan stage and the [Service Desk Single Engineer Group](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/incubation/service-desk/) are collaborating on [accelerating Service Desk](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8769), which will extend work items to support adjacent use cases to portfolio and team planning.
* Plan:Optimize is collaborating with Manage:organization to Consolidate [Value Stream Analytics Group & Project into a single object - Workspace](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9295).
* Plan:Optimize is collaborating with Analytics:Product Analytics to consolidate standalone analytics pages and reports to a [platform-level dashboarding framework](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/13801).
* Plan:Optimize is collaborating with Govern:Threat Insights to add [Vulnerabilities metrics to the Value Streams Dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/383697).
* Plan:Optimize is collaborating with AI:Framework team to create an [AI Impact Dashboard](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/12978) to better quantify the effect of using AI on productivity.
* Plan:Knowledge collaborates with Groups across all areas of GitLab to develop and improve upon the rich text editor. The rich text editor is a what you see is what you get editing experience, and is an alternative to the plain text editor which requires knowledge of markdown to leverage.
* Plan:Project Management is collaborating with Deploy:Environments on a [platform-level automation framework](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/13171).
