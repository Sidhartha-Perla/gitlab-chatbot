The Plan Stage is made up of four groups supporting all major categories needed to plan work for DevOps organizations, including:

- The Project Management group focuses on the needs of individual engineering teams to plan their work. Core features include Issues, Work Items and Iterations to help teams plan, track, triage, and complete their work.
- The Product Planning group focuses on connecting the work that engineering teams perform to higher level strategy, across multiple teams and in longer time horizons (quarters or years). Core features include Epics and Roadmaps.
- The Knowledge group focuses on enabling users to create, share, use and manage the knowledge and information of an organization. Core features include the Content Editor, Pages and Wiki.
- The Optimize group focuses on enabling organizations to uncover opportunities to continuously improve upon their software development lifecycle. Core features include Value Stream Management and DORA metrics.
