In three years, the Plan Stage market will:
* Continue to shift from project to product and focus on outcomes instead of output.
* Continue to move away from command and control mentality and instead empower teams to determine how they can contribute toward business objectives.
* Make operational efficiency and continual improvement a top priority.  
* Embrace AI within the Plan stage of the DevSecOps toolchain and lifecycle.
* Shift toward consolidation into a single platform for all stages of the DevSecOps lifecycle.

As a result, in three years, Gitlab will:
* Provide support for individual DevSecOps teams and entire organizations, keeping Agile frameworks in mind.
* Allow GitLab to capture and tie metrics to [Work Items](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/work_items.html) to reflect business outcomes. 
* Surface metrics like DORA, Flow and Value Stream in key parts of a teams workflow to help drive improvements. 
* Support frameworks like OKRs that encourage bottom-up contributions. 
* Use downstream DevSecOps data for automation and AI to help teams improve their plans.
* Make it easy for non-Developer Personas to contribute in GitLab.
