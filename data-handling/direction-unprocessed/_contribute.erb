## Contributing

At GitLab, one of our values is that everyone can contribute. If you're looking to
get involved with features in the <%= stageKey.capitalize %> area, there are a couple searches you can use
to find issues to work on:

- [Contribute for Prize](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Contribute%20for%20prize&label_name[]=devops%3A%3A<%= stageKey %>) items are the best place to start: these have been pre-selected as being ready to go, and you can win a prize by contributing to them. More details on the `Contribute for Prize` program is available on our [Contributor Success operations](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/contributor-success/community-contributors-workflows/#supporting-the-wider-community-contributors) page.
- [Seeking community contributions](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Seeking%20community%20contributions&label_name[]=devops%3A%3A<%= stageKey %>) items are generally frontend development (or at least minimal backend), are very self-contained, and are great, very visible items that can make a big difference when it comes to usability.
- [UI Polish](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=UI+polish&label_name%5B%5D=devops%3A%3A<%= stageKey %>&scope=all&state=opened) items are open to contribution. These are generally a bit more complicated, so if you're interested in contributing we recommend you open up a dialog with us in the issue.
- [Community contribution](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Community%20contribution&label_name[]=devops%3A%3A<%= stageKey %>) items may already have some contributors working on them if you want to join up. There aren't always issues here to find.
