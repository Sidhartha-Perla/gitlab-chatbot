## Purpose
This page is for high-level prioritization of the security insights team for 16.0-16.11. It primarily includes feature/product items and is not a comprehensive list of everything that will be worked such as bugs, implementation issues, documentation, or technical debt. It is not intended as a replacement or alternative for our issue boards. It is meant as an easily consumable single view of the main in-progress and upcoming work items for the Security Insights group. It also allows mixing Epics and Issues in a single list.  The tables come from the [security_insights.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/product_priorities/security_insights.yml) file.
This list is not a guarantee of timing or order of delivery. Rather, use this as a guide to see the tops items we are working on and will be in the near future. The list purposefully does not extend out beyond a year to minimize a false sense of priority.

## Goals
1. Leadership can see a project, sub-group, group or instance level view of their vulnerabilities AND their dependencies at each level.
1. Teams can quickly triage their vulnerabilities and dependencies with filters, searching and grouping within the vulnerability and dependency report. When possible, repetitive triage tasks are automated.
1. Developers trust that new vulnerabilities on their branch are accurate.
