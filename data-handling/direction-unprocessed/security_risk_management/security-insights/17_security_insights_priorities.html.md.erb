## Purpose
This page is for high-level prioritization of the secureity insights team for 17.0-17.11. It primarily includes feature/product items and is not a comprehensive list of everything that will be worked on such as bugs, implementation issues, documentation, or technical debt. It is not intended as a replacement or alternative for our issue boards. It is meant as an easily consumable single view of the main in-progress and upcoming work items for the Security Insights group. It also allows mixing Epics and Issues in a single list.  The tables come from the [security_insights.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/product_priorities/security_insights_17.yml) file.
This list is not a guarantee of timing or order of delivery. Rather, use this as a guide to see the top items we are working on and will be in the near future. The list purposefully does not extend out beyond a year to minimize a false sense of priority.

## Goals
1. Leadership has a single, comprehensive view of the application's security posture and risk exposure.  They can quickly answer their questions in GitLab's Vulnerability Report, Dependency List and Security Dashboards.
1. Teams can track vulnerabilities across multiple branches and releases and understand declared vs. transitive dependencies.
1. Developers are notified when new vulnerabilities arise and know how to get started mitigating vulnerabilities before involving security teams.
