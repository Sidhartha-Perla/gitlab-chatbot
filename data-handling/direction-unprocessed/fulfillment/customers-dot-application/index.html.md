## Mission

> Within the category of the CustomersDot and quote to cash (QTC) integrations the mission is to provide robust billing infrastructure and ensure it is scalable as our business evolves. This initiative centers on building a foundation and optimizing the QTC orchestration with the customersDot application. By strengthening these critical components, contributors will gain the confidence and efficiency needed to deliver enhancements to the CustomersDot application swiftly and reliably. This strategic effort will also enable data integrity and governance, compliance, and reliability while also promoting seamless collaboration and innovation within the Fulfillment section at GitLab.

## Overview

Within [CustomersDot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/) our customers and all relevant stakeholders are able to manage billing accounts, subscriptions, add-ons and licenses.

[CustomersDot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/) is the central application to contribute for the Fulfillment Platform group.

The Fulfillment Platform group is responsible for the following areas of CustomersDot:

- Authentication system 
- Integration with Zuora, Salesforce ,and Channel partner eMarketplace solutions
- CustomersDot admin view and functionality
- Quote-to-Cash (QTC) data architecture and orchestration within CustomersDot
- Audit and compliance initiatives

The Fulfillment Platform group owns, maintains and evolves the underlying architecture and orchestration for GitLabâ€™s Quote-to-cash flow (QTC).

## Target audience

The target audience of the CustomersDot and quote to cash integrations spans all stakeholder groups, as it enables them to create and manage subscriptions with corresponding payments or quotes, customers, billing accounts, and licenses.

Therefore, we see the following parties interacting with CustomersDot
1. **Customers:** SSO with gitlab.com 
2. **Fulfillment groups and team members:** Plan and SKU management improvements and Cdot and billing rearchitecture 
3. **Internal stakeholders (Customer Success, Support, Sales, Billing operations):** Multiple active orders, Enabling Admin functions for subscription modifications, and Data integrity initiatives 


We are enhancing the overall customer experience for all our clients, whether they are self-service users, sales-assisted customers, or resellers, by optimizing infrastructure to create cohesive Quote to Cash flows.

## What's up now (up to 12 months)

Within the next 12 months we want to strengthen the foundation of the fulfillment platform which includes the following focus areas:

- Improve the billing infrastructure to align with existing and future QTC integrations
- Establish the application foundations for Fulfillment teams
- Make our billing infrastructure and underlying systems compliant 
- Introduce the partner eMarketplace integration to automate sales processes for public and private offers via AWS/GCP and other potential partners

The focus will help us to support the scale within Fulfillment and adjacent areas as GitLab continues to grow.
