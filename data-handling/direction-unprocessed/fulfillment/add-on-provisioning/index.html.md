## Mission
The Provision group's mission is to provide a seamless customer experience in accessing GitLab subscriptions, add-ons and trials, while providing key license delivery and usage data to internal teams for data-driven insights.

## Overview
The category of `Add-on Provisioning` focuses on providing access to GitLab's supplemental products that can be purchased alongside a main subscription plan. For these products, we provide purchase confirmation mailers, paid and trial feature activation/de-activation, and user-based provisioning.

Within our group, we categorize add-on offerings as either "consumption-based", which includes products like `Compute Minutes` and`Storage`, or "user-based" which includes products such as `Enterprise Agile Planning` and `GitLab Duo Pro`. We own provisioning of both of these add-on types.

## 1-year Plan
Over the next 12 months, the Provision team has three primary objectives:

1. Support the release of new product offerings
1. Expand trial availability and experience
1. Improve the user-based add-on seat assignment experience

#### Support release of new add-on product offerings
One of Provision's primary focus areas this year will be supporting the release of new products and features. We assist with ensuring features are accurately provisioned to customers on GitLab.com, GitLab Dedicated, and self managed instances. This year, we plan to support the release of the GitLab Duo Enterprise add-on. In FY24, we helped to launch:
 - [GitLab Duo Pro](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/) for [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10336), [GitLab Dedicated](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11715), and [self managed instances](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10613) as well as [Enterprise Agile Planning](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/packaging-and-pricing/ghidorah/-/epics/5).

#### Expand and improve trial availability
As GitLab continues to expand it's feature portfolio, we recognize the importance of allowing customers to trial these features ahead of committing to a purchase. In FY25, we intend to introduce a trial for [GitLab Duo Pro](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10988) and [GitLab Duo Enterprise](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/13775) for all deployment types.

#### Improve the user-based add-on seat assignment experience
[GitLab Duo](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/) and [Enterprise Agile Planning](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) are the first GitLab product offerings requiring user-based assignment. In FY24, we introduced user provisioning for GitLab Duo Pro. This year, we plan to continue to iterate on this experience by introducing [user sorting and filtering](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11276) and [the ability to assign users in bulk](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11462), both through the UI and other methods such as LDAP & SAML. In addition, we intend to begin supporting user-based provisioning and enforcement for Enterprise Agile Planning. 

### Other Attention Areas
