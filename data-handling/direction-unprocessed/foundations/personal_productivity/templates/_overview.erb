The Personal productivity group is responsible for foundational features of GitLab that contribute to the overall useability of the application. 

This includes the main feature workflows at GitLab in our navigation &amp; settings category, which is the main highway through which our users access the application. We want our navigation to be helpful, accessible, and integrated with search. 

In addition, the vision for our design system is to drive the creativity of our product design and engineering teams so they can build valuable and delightful features. Our focus on the design system ultimately ensures a more consistent, usable, and accessible interface for our customers.
