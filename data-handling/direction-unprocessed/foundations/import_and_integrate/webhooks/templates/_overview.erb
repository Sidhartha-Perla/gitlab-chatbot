Webhooks are a generic way for projects to be integrated with any other service. GitLab's APIs allow other services to reach in to our data, whereas Webhooks proactively send data to another service when certain events happen. These are increasingly important for external vendors, as they offer a key way to integrate with GitLab that doesn't require them building inside our codebase. Webhooks also give users, customers, and partners a more efficient pattern for receiving data triggered based on events, rather than inefficiently polling to see if any new events are available.

While we recognize the importance of robust webhook functionality for enabling integrations and partner ecosystems, the Import and Integrate team has prioritized migration capabilities for FY26 in alignment with GitLab's company objectives. This means that Webhooks will continue to remain in maintenance mode.
