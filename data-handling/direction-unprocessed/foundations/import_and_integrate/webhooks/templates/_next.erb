### Webhooks Maintenance Status

For FY26, the Webhooks category will remain in maintenance mode due to the Import and Integrate team's focus on migration capabilities, within Importers category.

We will continue to:

- Maintain existing webhook functionality
- Support community contributions
- Address critical bugs and security issues

However, active development of new webhook features by the Import and Integrate team is not planned for FY26.
