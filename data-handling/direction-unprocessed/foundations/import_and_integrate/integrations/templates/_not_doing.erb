#### Building a "marketplace"

While a marketplace for GitLab integrations and extensions could provide significant value in the future, it has been deprioritized for FY26. Our strategic brief considers this as a potential longer-term initiative, but current resource constraints prevent us from pursuing it at this time.

#### Improvements to GitLab for Slack and Microsoft Teams integrations

Although enhancing these integrations would support customer retention and satisfaction, we have deprioritized these improvements for FY26 to focus on migration capabilities.

#### Developing new domain-specific integrations

Import and Integrate group won't focus on developing new integrations, but we will continue to support other GitLab product groups, partners, and Community contributors in doing that.
