### Current Focus and Priorities

For FY26, the Import and Integrate team is prioritizing Importers Category:

- Strengthening customer confidence with migration by direct transfer General Availability
- Simplifying and speeding up contribution and membership mapping after imports
- Enabling semi-automated migrations between offline GitLab instances
- Providing a format for building importers for third-party software

These priorities align with GitLab's company objectives.

### Integrations Maintenance Status

We will continue to maintain existing integrations to ensure they remain functional, but we will not be actively developing new features for integrations during FY26. This approach allows us to focus our resources on migration capabilities while ensuring that existing integrations continue to work as expected.
Our popular integrations like GitLab for Slack and Jira integrations will be maintained, but new feature development is currently on hold.
