GitLab's vision is to be the best [single application for every part of the DevOps toolchain](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/gitlab-the-product/single-application/). However, we acknowledge that to achieve this, there are many workflows, custom scripts, and nuanced integrations that customers require and GitLab may not be able to prioritize.
To make the most impact and keep the Integrations category sustainable, we have been focusing on improvements to the technical foundations of integrations as well as documentation, guides, and best practices to assist the broader community in contributing to integrations.
For FY26, the Import and Integrate team will be focusing primarily on improving migration capabilities between GitLab instances and from third-party tools to GitLab. Due to resource constraints and alignment with company objectives, we have deprioritized active development of integrations for this fiscal year.
