In 2024, we are focused on two main areas:

- Bringing [project migration by direct transfer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/import/index.html#migrated-project-items-beta) to [general availability](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/experiment-beta-support.html#generally-available-ga), so that we offer production-quality, easy to use tool for migrating GitLab resources between instances of GitLab. It should gracefully recover from errors and import over nearly 100% of relevant objects.

Ability to migrate projects by direct transfer was released as Beta (available to everyone) [in GitLab 15.8](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/01/18/try-out-new-way-to-migrate-projects/).

- Improving high-priority Integrations, Atlassian Jira and Slack in order to reach Complete [maturity level](../../../../maturity).
