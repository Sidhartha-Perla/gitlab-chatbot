Please be aware that we are putting API category in maintenance mode from FY24Q2 (May 2023) due to lack of resources. There will be no dedicated investment in this category until further notice. We will revisit this in planning for FY25.

We will only support the most critical and severe bug fixes with significant business impact while we shift our attention to improve high-priority importers, GitLab to GitLab importer, GitHub importer and BitBucket Server importer.
