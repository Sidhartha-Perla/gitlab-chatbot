GitLab offers a REST and GraphQL API to give customers options on how to best integrate with GitLab. Until now, we have not developed a cohesive strategy that optimizes for parity between them and efficiency in maintaining both implementations.

Import and Integrate group facilitates the discussion around our APIs with a key objective of improving usability, reliability, and performance for customers and partners in our ecosystem.

To identify the key areas of focus and foster cross-functional support, we've established a working group to drive these topics forward.

The [Import and Integrate group](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#import-and-integrate-group) will focus on creating a joint REST and GraphQL API strategy and other possible improvements like:

* Testing our [POC for a REST wrapper over our GraphQL API](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363795), dubbed `Raisin`.
* Exploring mechanisms for [Automated Documentation](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5792), ideally generating OpenAPI specs based on our REST APIs.
