### Introduction and how you can help

Thanks for visiting this category direction page on Importers in GitLab. This page belongs to the [Import and Integrate](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#import-and-integrate-group) group of the Foundations stage and is maintained by the group's Product Manager, [Magdalena Frankiewicz](https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz) ([E-mail](mailto:mfrankiewicz@gitlab.com), [Calendly](https://calendly.com/gitlab-magdalenafrankiewicz/45mins)).

This direction page is a work in progress, and everyone can contribute:

- Please comment and contribute in the linked [issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Category%3AImporters&first_page_size=100) and [epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics?state=opened&page=1&sort=start_date_desc&label_name[]=Category:Importers) on this page. Sharing your feedback directly on GitLab.com is the best way to contribute to our strategy and vision.
 - Please share feedback directly via email, Twitter, or on a video call. If you're a GitLab user and want to discuss how GitLab can improve Importers, we'd especially love to hear from you.

### Strategy and Themes

<!-- Describe your category. Capture the main problems to be solved in market (themes). Describe how you intend to solve these with GitLab (strategy). Provide enough context that someone unfamiliar with the details of the category can understand what is being discussed. -->

<%= partial("direction/foundations/import_and_integrate/importers/templates/overview") %>

### 1 year plan
<!--
1 year plan for what we will be working on linked to up-to-date epics. This section will be most similar to a "road-map". Items in this section should be linked to issues or epics that are up to date. Indicate relative priority of initiatives in this section so that the audience understands the sequence in which you intend to work on them.
 -->

<%= partial("direction/foundations/import_and_integrate/importers/templates/next") %>

#### What is next for us
<!-- This is a 3 month look ahead for the next iteration that you have planned for the category. This section must provide links to issues or
or to [epics](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#epics-for-a-single-iteration) that are scoped to a single iteration. Please do not link to epics encompass a vision that is a longer horizon and don't lay out an iteration plan. -->

In Q2 we're working to strengthen customer confidence by [bringing migration by direct transfer to General Availability](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11398).

#### What we recently completed
<!-- Lookback limited to 3 months. Link to the relevant issues or release post items. -->

**Simplify and speed up contribution and membership mapping after imports**
Mapping user contributions after migrations was a manual, time-consuming process that must have beeen done through the UI one user at a time. For organizations with hundreds or thousands of users, this was a significant bottleneck.
We've implemented [bulk CSV-based mapping](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/16765) to dramatically reduce the effort required to preserve user contributions during migrations. This enhancement benefits not just migration by direct transfer between GitLab instances but also third-party importers, including those for GitHub, Bitbucket Server and Gitea.
This work has been delivered in Q1 FY26.

#### What is Not Planned Right Now
<!--  Often it's just as important to talk about what you're not doing as it is to
discuss what you are. This section should include items that people might hope or think
we are working on as part of the category, but aren't, and it should help them understand why that's the case.
Also, thinking through these items can often help you catch something that you should
in fact do. We should limit this to a few items that are at a high enough level so
someone with not a lot of detailed information about the product can understand -->

Given our focus on the initiatives above, we are not currently prioritizing:

- Implementing a Jira Server importer - This has been deprioritized for FY26 given resource constraints and other priorities.
- Improvements to GitLab for Slack and Microsoft Teams integrations - While important, these have been deprioritized due to resource constraints.
- Creating a GitLab marketplace for integrations - This longer-term initiative has been moved to future consideration.

The Import and Integrate group is not focused on the ability to regularly back up and restore your GitLab data, for example nightly backups of all your data. For more information on this use case, please see the [Backup and Restore category direction page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/geo/backup_restore/).

### Best in Class Landscape
<!-- Blanket description consistent across all pages that clarifies what GitLab means when we say "best in class" -->

BIC (Best In Class) is an indicator of forecated near-term market performance based on a combination of factors, including analyst views, market news, and feedback from the sales and product teams. It is critical that we understand where GitLab appears in the BIC landscape.

#### Key Capabilities
<!-- For this product area, these are the capabilities a best-in-class solution should provide -->

This table provides a quick overview of what GitLab importers exist today and which most important objects they each support. This list is not exhaustive and the detailed information can be found on the [Importers documentation page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/).

### Professional Services and Migration Support

While our long-term goal is to provide all the GitLab importing capabilities needed by our customers in our application, we recognize that specific migration scenarios may require additional support.
GitLab [Professional Services](https://about.gitlab.com/services/) team uses the [Congregate](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/tools/migration/congregate) tool to orchestrate user, group, and project import API calls to help customers automate scaled migrations. With migration by direct transfer reaching GA status, we'll be able to enhance the capabilities of Congregate and provide a more reliable and scalable migration experience for our largest customers.

For complex migrations, especially for large enterprise customers moving to GitLab Dedicated, we recommend engaging with our Professional Services team to ensure a smooth transition.

### How to Provide Feedback

If you have feedback on our importers, please share it on our [feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284495). Your input helps us improve these tools for everyone.
