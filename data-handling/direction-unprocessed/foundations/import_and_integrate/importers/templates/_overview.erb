A typical organization looking to adopt GitLab already has many other tools. Artifacts such as code, issues, and epics may already exist and are being used daily. Seamless transition of work in progress is critically important, and a great experience during this migration creates a positive first impression of GitLab. Solving these transitions, even for complex cases, is crucial for GitLab's ability to expand in the market. Instilling confidence in users that their data will be migrated quickly and with maximum care is of utmost importance.
Supporting GitLab's objectives of driving first order growth, accelerating customer value, and enabling customer-focused innovation, the Import and Integrate group is focused on making imports reliable and performant at any scale. Large-scale moves to GitLab should be significantly easier and ultimately reach a first-class experience level.

Our focus areas for improvement include:

* **Ease of use**
Customers looking to import their data sometimes struggle to find the place in GitLab where they can initiate imports. Once found, the user interactions are not always intuitive, and the flow is not fully user-friendly. Improving the user experience in this area will make our importers more lovable.

* **Reliability**
A portion of our current issues are related to the solution's reliability. Imports don't always succeed, and when they fail, there is little guidance for users on steps they can take to remedy the failure. We are working on making our importers more reliable so that our customers can have confidence in the migration process.

* **Scalability and performance**
Large organizations looking to move possibly hundreds or thousands of projects from tools like GitHub or Bitbucket to GitLab, or from self-managed GitLab instances to GitLab.com or [GitLab Dedicated](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/),  need to be able to do so efficiently and reliably.

#### Current Focus Areas

The Import and Integration group is primarily focused on:

* Migrations between GitLab instances - enabling seamless transitions between self-managed instances, GitLab.com, and GitLab Dedicated.
* Imports from source control tools - supporting migrations from platforms like GitHub, Bitbucket, and others.
* Standardizing importers - improving consistency, security, and performance across all importers.
