Manage operates under GitLab's values, but is a stage that seeks to particularly excel in certain areas that support our goals above. We seek to be leaders at GitLab by:

### Iterate on the essential
* Leading the way on iteration, regularly shooting for small but ambitious MVCs.
* Supporting iteration with a great planning and development process, giving us checkpoints to keep issues small and incremental. As a result, our throughput is high.
* Valuing the 1-year themes above, and deliberately deciding to not pursue initiatives that don’t support our 2020 goals. We'd rather do a few things well than a bunch of things poorly.
* Prioritizing depth over breadth. For the most part, we’re biased toward doubling down and investing on what’s working rather than extending the breadth of our stage.

### Measure what matters
* Prioritizing instrumentation through our North Star dashboards, which we regularly monitor to keep our priorities in check.
* Measuring business value by tying customer delight and revenue to our priorities.

### Great team
* Aspiring to be the happiest team at GitLab, with high individual job satisfaction.
* Having great work-life balance, ensuring that we [value friends and family above work](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#family-and-friends-first-work-second) and avoid individual burnout.
