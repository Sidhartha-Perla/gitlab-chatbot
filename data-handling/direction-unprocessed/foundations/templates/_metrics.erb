Manage uses [Stage MAU](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/performance-indicators/) as a primary measure of success. This represents the unique number of users getting value from the stage; all groups should be able to contribute to improving this number.

Individual groups track progress against a number of group-specific [performance indicators](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/performance-indicators/) _All links are to the internal handbook_:
