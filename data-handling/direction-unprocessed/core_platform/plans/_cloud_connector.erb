### Cloud Connector

GitLab Cloud Connector is a way to access services common to multiple GitLab deployments, instances, and cells. GitLab customers can choose between the following deployment options:
- GitLab.com’s multi-tenant SaaS offering.
- Deploying their own self-managed GitLab instance.
- Signing up for GitLab Dedicated, our managed single-tenant solution.
The goal of GitLab Cloud Connector is to ensure that GitLab features can work equally across all three. This aligns with Core Platform’s mission of accelerating other product groups by reducing the friction of developing for multiple deployments.

In FY25, we will work to formalize the technical boundaries for Cloud Connector by integrating at least two different services: AI gateway and TanuKey. This experience will help us iterate towards a framework-like solution where new feature teams can self-service their own Cloud Connector integration.

You can learn more about Cloud Connector group plans on the [Cloud Connector Direction page](/direction/cloud-connector/).
