### Global Search

You can read the Global Search group plan on the [Global Search Direction page](/direction/global-search/).

For FY23 - Global Search provides a search experience across the entire GitLab Instance. 
The focus is on expanding the userâ€™s needs to include new scopes as GitLab features. 
Vulnerabilities search will include multiple ways for sort and filter allowing users to quickly map find Vulnerabilities across groups and projects. 
Pipelines and Jobs Search will make it easier to find CI/CD components across multiple groups.
Snippets Search will make it easier for users to share snippets across their organization.  
Along with adding these additional scopes, we will be enhancing the Advanced Search experience to include additional ways to sort and filter results. 
Adding new content into its own search verticals puts pressure on the user to discover these sections and look at each one individually. To Improve this we will be adding an All results default view that will combine all scopes. 


##### Code Search

Code Search will focus on addressing the needs of Big Code, Which includes several key areas of focus.

* [Federated Search - Search that can include Self-managed and SaaS instances](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6221). Better would be the ability to source content from Non-GitLab Repos
* [Elasticsearch Integration for Core/Free](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6222) - This would provide faster results and have a much smaller footprint if not including code.
* [Local Editor Functionality](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6223)
  * Exact Match
  * More than one line of results per file.
  * RegEx Syntax for Variable specified in code search
  * Case Sensitivity
* [Code Language Filtering](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6236)
* [Relevancy Improvements 2](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/22553) - This would be also include Sorting options.
* [LSIF for Code Structure to be Specified in the Search.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223150)
* [Infrastructure investment](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6248)- 400% over 2 years. Scaling needs to be flexible.
* [Platform change- (This might be required to solve these problems. ) Like zoekt](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339121)

##### Code Navigation
Growing out of the early delivery of Code Intelligence, Code Navigation will bring more Local IDE style use cases to your Web IDE and across multiple Groups and Projects. 
Details specific to this delivery are in Discovery currently.
