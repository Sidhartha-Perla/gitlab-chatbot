### Geo

You can read the Geo group plan on the [Geo Direction page](/direction/geo/).

In FY23, the Geo group is focused on delivering [Complete maturity for Disaster Recovery](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3574). Disaster Recovery is a common, must-have, requirement for large enterprises, allowing them to feel comfortable that GitLab can remain available for their developers to be productive throughout a variety of disaster scenarios.

In FY23, Geo also plans to deliver [Complete maturity for Geo Replication](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1508), another key feature for large enterprises with multiple offices, or the growing number of businesses embracing remote work. Geo-replication enables organizations to set up additional GitLab nodes throughout the world, enabling these users to work efficiently by reducing the latency and time it takes to perform common tasks like cloning or pulling container images.

In Q1 FY23, we will re-evaluate the priority of the backup and restore category and are going to assess [all currently open issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Category%3ABackup%2FRestore%20of%20GitLab%20instances) to define the priorities further.
