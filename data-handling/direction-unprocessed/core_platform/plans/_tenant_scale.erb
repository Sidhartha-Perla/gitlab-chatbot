### Tenant Scale

You can read the Tenant Scale Group plan on the [Tenant Scale Direction page](/direction/enablement/tenant-scale/).

The Tenant Scale Group is concerned with delivering application changes that allow GitLab and GitLab.com to scale to millions of users and implement the strategies defined in the [Database Scalability Working Group](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/working-groups/database-scalability/).

In FY23, we expect GitLab.com will transition to run on multiple databases that are decomposed by feature. We expect that at least two independent databases exist: `main` and `ci`. This will provide significant headroom and will allow the Tenant Scale group to transition towards validating proposals for scaling GitLab even further.

Decomposition is only a first step to unlocking further scalability for GitLab. By the end of FY23, the Tenant Scale Group will have evaluated and implemented other scalability options for GitLab. There are several possible options that will have to be evaluated, including but not limited to sharding GitLab's database using existing PostgreSQL tooling, adopting [Vitess](https://vitess.io/), moving towards a Cell-like architecture and utilizing different datastores that fit specific use cases.
