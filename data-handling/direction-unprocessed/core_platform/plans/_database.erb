### Database

The Database group is focused on improving the scalability, performance, and resilience of GitLab's database layer as well as instituting best practices across the wider development organization.

You can learn more about Database group plans on the [Database Direction page](/direction/database/).

For FY23, the group is working on the following key themes:

* Ensuring that the database continues to scale
  * Update the [database tooling](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6841) and our [framework for executing background migrations](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6840) to support multiple databases
  * [Reduce tables sizes to < 100 GB per physical table](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6211) ([analysis](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/database_scaling/size-limits.html))
* Improving the efficiency and reliability of making database changes
  * [Batched Background Migrations - General Availability](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6751)
  * [Automated database testing using production clones: Advanced database testing features](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/database-team/-/epics/10)
  * [Database Schema Validation](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3928)
