### Distribution

In FY23 (CY 2022), the Distribution team will focus on several main themes:
  * Improve the upgrade rate of instances, by polishing the upgrade experience
  * Reduce the time it takes to deploy and operate GitLab, especially for large-scale deployments
  * Achieve Loveable maturity of our Cloud Native installation
  * Complete maturity of the GitLab Operator according to the [Operator Framework capabilities](https://operatorframework.io/operator-capabilities/).

You can learn more about Distribution group plans on the [Distribution Direction page](/direction/distribution/).

#### Goals

1. Improve the upgrade rate of instances
  * For single-node instances, [automatically upgrade based on user preferences](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15993)
  * For mult-node Omnibus instances, [make it easy to perform zero downtime upgrades](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-environment-toolkit) with minimal risk
  * For cloud native, add support for [automated zero-downtime upgrades](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gl-openshift/gitlab-operator/-/issues/59) in the Operator

2. [Reduce the time it takes to deploy and operate scaled GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-environment-toolkit)
  * Automated deployments of reference architectures on AWS, GCP, and Azure
  * Automated zero downtime upgrades 
  * Automated Geo promotions and demotions

3. [Achieve Loveable maturity of our Cloud Native installation](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5796)
  * Achieve feature parity between Omnibus and Chart based deployment options. New features are launched simultaneously on both Omnibus and Cloud Native
  * Clear and concise documentation for cloud-native installs so that configuration options are easily discoverable and users can more easily deploy in Kubernetes without relying on support from internal GitLab teams. 
  * Test the Helm chart and Operator install at different scales, develop reference architectures, and offer best in class solution for installing GitLab in a cloud environment. 

4. [Complete maturity of the GitLab Operator](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6958)
  * Offer a Red Hat certified Operator
  * Make it easy for our existing Charts users to migrate to the Operator
  * Cloud Native users utilize Operator for more frequent upgrades
