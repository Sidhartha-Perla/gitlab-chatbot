## Vision

The Platform Insights team vision is to deliver a unified data event platform that allows users to query, visualize, and analyze their data in order to optimize their workflows within GitLab. We aim to create a consistent dashboard experience that makes it easy for users to ask the questions pertinent to their use cases and build rich team/use case specific views. The unified event platform will consume data from all stages so that users can monitor the health of their team, their processes, and their services all in a single pane of glass.

## Current Development Themes

While the Platform Insights team covers a range of categories, our two current investment areas are data unification and custom dashboards foundation. We are focused on solving problems for [modern development teams](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/personas/#sasha-software-developer) and the key to that is data!

### FY26 Key Investment themes
* Lead with SLDC Insights
* Elevate customer-centricity to customer obsession

### [Data unification](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/architecture/gitlab-data-analytics/-/epics/3)

GitLab's [data unification effort](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/architecture/gitlab-data-analytics/-/epics/3) seeks to define a consistent architecture for data ingestion, storage, synchronization and governance in an effort to reduce the risk and improve efficiency associated with how we handle analytical data in our systems. This is a cross-stage effort which requires a investment to [consolidate](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/architecture/gitlab-data-analytics/design-doc/-/blob/master/areas/consolidation.md) data across siloes.  

#### [FY25 Q4 Goals](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/work_items/9520) 

* Deliver a POC of the [new event platform](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/architecture/gitlab-data-analytics/-/epics/12) end-to-end with Optimize data source using NATS. Define a standard library of instrumenting and ingesting product usage data.
* Bring internal [Snowplow pipeline](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/architecture/gitlab-data-analytics/-/epics/9) for CPAA to parity with existing Snowplow-based Product Analytics architecture. This includes [dogfooding the monitor stack](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/architecture/gitlab-data-analytics/-/epics/11) as a replacement for our existing internal Snowplow pipeline.
* [Land Clickhouse](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/architecture/gitlab-data-analytics/-/epics/15) implementation plans for Dedicated and complete production readiness review for Clickhouse on .com

| [Custom Dashboards Foundation](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/monitor/platform-insights/custom-dashboards-foundation/) 

Dashboards are a core piece of any analytics workflow. Customers use them to track a variety of things from customer behavior to service health to team productivity/output. GitLab is striving to allow customers a single place to ask questions of their data, source agnostic, so that they can truly connect their code, delivery, team productivity, and customer outcomes in a single, unified visualization. We have heard the need for customers to be able to customize their reporting and build views that align with their team/project specific needs. 

The Platform Insights team developed a dashboard framework to serve as the single source of truth for the way GitLab internal teams should develop and deliver their prescriptive dashboard views. Our goal is that we catalog all the current analytics dashboards available in GitLab and iteratively migrate them to the standard dashboard framework in order to provide customers with a consistent user experience.

#### [FY25 Q4 Goals](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/work_items/9520)

* Resolve deviations from [dashboard framework for Optimize use cases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/503809) and complete an end-to-end POC for their high value dashboards, AI Impact analysis specifically
* [Improve the framework onboarding experience](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/505316) to ensure that we can quickly migrate all analytics dashboards including possible CI tools and comprehensive documentation
* [Decouple framework from Product analytics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/15691) 
* Expand design system documentation for dashboard interaction models and component roadmap in [Pajamas](https://design.gitlab.com/patterns/dashboards/)

## What's our 1 year plan?
    
Our goal for the year, starting in FY25 Q4, is to fully migrate all basic panel analytics dashboards to the standard framework, improve GitLab analytics discoverability, and provide an easy-to-use dasbhoard experience at the group/project levels so that customers are empowered to query and visualize their data in a manner that suits their reporting and monitoring needs. And, while the implementation of the data unification project should be invisible to the user, this effort is a core parallel effort required to ensure that we can provide a consistent experience across all GitLab data sources. This work will encompass consolidation, storage (for all deployement models,) synchronization, and governance, and will take into account the PII (GDPR, FedRAMP, etc) requirements that many of our customers abide by in their business.
