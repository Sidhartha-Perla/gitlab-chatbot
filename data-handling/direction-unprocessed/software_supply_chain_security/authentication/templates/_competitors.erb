## Competitive Landscape

[BitBucket / Atlassian Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/roadmap/cloud?selectedProduct=access) is working on higher level tokens that provide automation with scopes that are larger than those of an individual user. GitLab already has these covered with [project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html) and [group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.html) access tokens, and will be further refining this with [service accounts](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6777).

BitBucket is making their [external user features](https://www.atlassian.com/wac/roadmap/cloud/external-user-security-ga?p=ef00c758-4f) GA. These features allow companies to enforce 2FA policies on their users. They are also adding [automated provisioning support](https://www.atlassian.com/wac/roadmap/cloud/user-provisioning-for-bitbucket?p=dbe4af1e-48) into BitBucket from Atlassian Admin tools.

Longer term, BitBucket will add more [controls around securing tokens](https://www.atlassian.com/wac/roadmap/cloud/api-token-controls-security-improvements?category=userManagement;security;administration&p=e7c8f309-36) - something that seems to be a common theme, as it's very important to security posture and auditing. With their addition of project and group access tokens, I am expecting to see the security improvements become quick to follow since creating more highly privileged credentials leads to increased risk.

GitHub is taking their [granular permissions and applying them to tokens](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/622) for GraphQL, personal access tokens, and adding an [organization layer](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/556) to manage these tokens. 

Overall, the following themes are being addressed by each competitor's Authentication and Authorization (or equivalent) teams:
- Increased administrator control over settings, at a high level, then with more granularity at the project level
- Ability to create and manage users that belong to the Enterprise 
- Security compliance - auditing of credentials, abiding by principle of least privilege, short lived credentials
