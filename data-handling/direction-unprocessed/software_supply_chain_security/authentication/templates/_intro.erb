## Introduction and how you can help

Thanks for visiting the direction page for Authentication in GitLab. 

We've previously been called the "Access" team and the "Authentication and Authorization" team. Our focus has narrowed, and we are now the "Authentication" team.

If you'd like to have influence on what the group is working on, the best way to help is to comment on individual issues if they are of interest, and tag `@hsutor`, Product Manager, so she sees your message.
