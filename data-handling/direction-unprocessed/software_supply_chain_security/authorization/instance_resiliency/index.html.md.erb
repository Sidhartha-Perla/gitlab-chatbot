# Overview

In early 2021, we witnessed the [cryptomining CI co-evolution](https://layerci.com/blog/crypto-miners-are-killing-free-ci/), where free SaaS continuous integration platforms are being seriously compromised by the cryptocurrency mining attacks. In the wake of these industry-wide attacks, we instrumented a few practices to mitigate abuse for [on GitLab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/05/17/prevent-crypto-mining-abuse/), which impacts the experience of free and trial users.

Going forward, we needed a more proactive approach for monitoring, detecting, evaluating, preventing, and reacting to pipeline abuse.  Consequently the Instance Resiliency category focuses on features that help prevent and stop not only cryptomining abuse, but also any kind of behavior that might potentially compromise the safety of our users or the stability of our platform.  Most measures to prevent abuse also tend to introduce friction for end users.  This category is responsible for carefully weighing the tradeoffs of keeping the platform secure while also providing for a good end user experience.

## Confidential issues

Many issues are intentionally confidential despite our value of transparency.  This is because we don't want to make it obvious to abusers the exact details of our controls.  We aren't relying on "security by obscurity"; however, we also don't want to make it easier for the abusers.
