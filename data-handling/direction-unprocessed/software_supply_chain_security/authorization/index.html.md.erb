## Overview

This is the direction page for the Authorization group in the Software Supply Chain Security stage. The Authorization group is responsible for ensuring that an authenticated user has access to the proper resources within the application. Additionally, the group builds capabilities to detect and prevent malicious activity from occurring within GitLab environments.

1. [Permissions](permissions/)
2. [Instance Resiliency](instance_resiliency/)

## Priorities

The latest authorization priorities can be found in the FY26 Execution Roadmap [here (internal)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ABoGLJkQZNs3Y92NELNrRvjsbo_PNEjGMyCRVz2sU2A/edit?slide=id.g3322950f2e3_12_120#slide=id.g3322950f2e3_12_120)

From a product perspective, the team is focused on the following:
* [Granular permissions for the Admin Area or Custom Admin Role](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/15069)
* [Granular permissions for job tokens](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/14804)
