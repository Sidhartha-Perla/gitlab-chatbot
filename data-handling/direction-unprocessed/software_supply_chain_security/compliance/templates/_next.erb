The Compliance group handles the three categories [listed above](#categories-we-focus-on) and focuses 
on advancing each of them. This means we will prioritize some before others.

Some of the top themes are listed below. Please note these are the highlights and not a comprehensive list. Each specific category page has additional details on the other epics and issues for the category we are focused on.

1. [Clickhouse audit event database migration](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10241)
  * Scalability for managing audit events is instrumental future plans, as we work to support higher-volume events, improve performance for existing events, support more complex quries, introduce immutable audit events, and add full-text search support.
  * Until we have this enhancement, our current architecture has necessitated a 30-day limit on querying audit events.
1. Expanding streaming audit events support across GitLab instance, group, and project level
1. [Adding event type filtering to streaming audit events](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6980)
1. [Integrating with 3rd-party Audit event storage solutions](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7792): 
  * Our users frequently wish to view audit events outside of GitLab, combine them with other data sources, and process them in some way.
  Rather than require users to manually download events from our API, we will deliver new audit events as they occur over a webhook. This way
  users can listen to the webhook and take any relevant action as soon as a new event occurs.
  * Third-party storage solutions benefit GitLab, since it means we do not have to store and manage the potentially millions of events that are generated and we can start recording higher-volume audit events that users are interested in, such as [Git activity](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/11650).
1. Offer [Audit Event Retention Settings](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7917) to allow organizations to ensure that their audit data is retained however they like, rather than using a default behavior.
1. [Compliance Standards Adherence Reporting](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7854)
  * Our initial [Adherence Reporting MVC](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11052) will cover common merge request settings violations that affect common compliance requirements.
  * Our Compliance Standards Adherence Reporting will continue to evolve to support the most common standards and frameworks leveraged by our customers, which may include SOX, SOC 2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR, among others.
1. Adding new and refactoring existing audit events ([epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/736))
    * One of our users key needs is that our audit event system is comprehensive enough to record all the sensitive activities that occur in GitLab. Because GitLab releases every month, we will focus on adding new events to ensure our customers have the visibility they need.
