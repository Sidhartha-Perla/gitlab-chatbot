SSCS is focused on providing governance and compliance features that span across the DevSecOps lifecycle. SSCS's tiering strategy aligns with the GitLab approach of selecting the tier based on [who cares most about the feature](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/pricing/#three-tiers).  Because Executives generally care most about governance features, it is expected that most SSCS features will land in the Ultimate tier.

##### Free
This tier is the primary way to increase broad adoption of the SSCS stage, as well as encouraging community contributions and improving security across the entire GitLab user base.

As a general rule of thumb, features will fall in the Free tier when they meet one or more of the following criteria:
* The feature is highly useful for an individual with a few small projects rather than meeting the needs of an organization or enterprise that is operating at scale.
* The feature is provided by an integration with an open source project rather than being natively developed by GitLab.

##### Premium
This tier is not a significant part of SSCS's pricing strategy; however, a few features features that primarily appeal to Directors rather than Executives may fall into the Premium tier. One example of this is our audit event functionality that is available in this tier.

##### Ultimate
This tier is the primary focus for the SSCS stage as most SSCS features enable executives to ensure that their organization meets compliance requirements and maintains an acceptable security posture.

As a general rule of thumb, features will fall in the Ultimate tier when they meet one or more of the following criteria:
* The feature is focused on enabling an organization or enterprise to operate at scale rather than an individual with a few small projects.
* The feature is natively developed by GitLab rather than being provided by an open source project.
