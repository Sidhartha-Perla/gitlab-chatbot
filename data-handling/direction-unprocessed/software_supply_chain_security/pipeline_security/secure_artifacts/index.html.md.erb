### Introduction and how you can help

Thanks for visiting this category direction page on Secure Artifacts in GitLab. This page belongs to the [Pipeline Security](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#pipeline-security-group) group of the Govern stage and is maintained by Jocelyn Eillis ([E-Mail](mailto:jeillis@gitlab.com)). 

This direction page is a work in progress, and everyone can contribute:

 - Please comment and contribute in the linked [issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?sort=updated_desc&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Category%3ASecrets%20Management&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Apipeline%20security&first_page_size=100) and [epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics?state=opened&page=1&sort=start_date_desc&label_name[]=Category:Secure+Artifacts) on this page. Sharing your feedback directly on GitLab.com is the best way to contribute to our strategy and vision.
 - Please share feedback directly via [email](mailto:jeillis@gitlab.com) or schedule a [video call](https://calendly.com/jeillis). If you're a GitLab user and have direct knowledge of your need for securing artifacts as part of securing your software supply chain, we'd especially love to hear from you.

### Overview
<!-- Describe your category so that someone who is not familar with the market space can understand what the product does. -->

Artifacts are a by-product produced during the software development process. They can be used as a roadmap to trace the development process. Securing release artifacts is a critical piece to ensure [software supply chain security](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/supply-chain/). Secure Artifacts includes:

1. Signed artifacts
1. Tamper-proofing of artifacts
1. Notification of tampering/potential security breach of artifacts (i.e. counterfeit signature)
1. Authentication of artifacts
1. Artifact access and restrictions

We are focused on providing capabilities to provide signature and verification of artifacts in compliance with Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) guidelines.
