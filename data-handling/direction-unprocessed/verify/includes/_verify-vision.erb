### Continuous Integration Vision

From this [mission](/direction/verify/#continuous-integration-mission), our vision is that by 2028, GitLab CI will be seen as the market leader for programmable AI-powered CI/CD, proven to run at scale for all software development use cases.

We will execute this vision by:
1. Introducing AI-powered pipeline authoring workflows to enable development teams to focus on delivering business value instead of pipeline configurations.
1. Allowing a seamless migration from other CI tools to GitLab CI as organizations consolidate their toolchains onto the GitLab DevSecOps platform.
1. Delivering the best experience for pipelines as code, improving how Software Developers alongside DevOps Engineers author pipelines and configure their `.gitlab-ci.yml` files.
1. Empowering visibility to changes made to code before production, compute minutes consumption, as well as natively compliant, secure supply chain workflows to support the building, testing, and optimizing of code from a single CI tool.
1. Leverage the data in the end-to-end GitLab DevOps platform to inform optimizations that result in fast, reliable pipelines and eliminate developer pain points that impact productivity.
1. Growing GitLab.com users by investing in [GitLab-hosted first](/direction/#product-strategy) and scaling our capabilities to meet Enterprise-level needs.

In addition to the vision outlined above, another goal is for CI/CD to be a critical enabler of the GitLab three-year strategy. Now, a CI/CD pipeline on its own, while critically valuable to the modern DevSecOps lifecycle, only tells part of the story of whether a software development team is delivering value as efficiently as possible. Therefore, our strategy over the next three years is to help businesses realize value faster by integrating the GitLab pipeline experience into areas of the platform focused on software delivery practice. 

For example, a developer can view DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics at the aggregate level in the [Value Streams Dashboard](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/value_streams_dashboard.html). However, providing the developer with the DORA metric for a specific commit within the CI/CD pipeline experience offers real-time visibility and empowers the developer to make immediate changes to improve business results.

The rationale for this strategy is as follows. There are various approaches in the industry today for authoring CI/CD workflows. Those options range from a declarative language such as YAML, an actions-style DSL, to procedural programming languages like Starlark. At the core of these various approaches is one constant - developers want simple-to-learn and use automation solutions regardless of the type of application they are developing. In the future, there will undoubtedly be new approaches for CI/CD pipelines entering the market. So, while the underlying automation authoring engine may change, the end goal of what we must achieve as software developers will remain the same.

Thus, the fundamental pillar of the GitLab Verify stage differentiation and platform support strategy is integrating the CI/CD experience at the developer persona level with other areas of the GitLab platform to enable the efficient delivery of secure software at scale.
