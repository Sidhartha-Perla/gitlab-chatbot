<!-- The following sections should be included in this Letter From the Editor: 

Summary - Provide a TL;DR of the following four paragraphs

State of Play - Say thanks to your team and your community, outline group size and capacity, briefly outline the current state.

Looking Back - Outline what we set out to do via our category maturity, SMAU goals, and any key JTBD you had aimed to improve. Outline your progress against those goals (and a projection of where you think we will end up) as well as any new initiatives that you prioritized over initial goals.

Looking Forward - Outline your plan for FY23 along those same axis (maturity, usage, and JTBD goals) including how your group's focus and goals will change throughout the year. It might be helpful to communicate this in quarter-by-quarter boundaries.

How we can accelerate - Outline your preferred option to accelerate your FY23 plan in the form of an investment case or other leadership asks. --> 

### Pipeline Security Letter from the Editor

To GitLab Community and Pipeline Security Users, 

FY23 is bringing a lot of opportunity for the Pipeline Security Team. This letter will walk you through the team changes, what we thought we would accomplish in FY22 and what we are expecting to accomplish in FY23. We also have a thought experiment where we accelerate our direction by suggesting an increase in headcount. 

First things first, my name is [Jackie Porter](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/#jreporter) and I am the Acting Product Manager for the Pipeline Security Group. We have also had some changes in the Pipeline Security team over the past 12 months. I'd like to introduce our Fullstack Engineering Manager, [Scott Hampton](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/#shampton), who has been our fearless leader over the 4 Pipeline Security engineering teammates. We currently have [1 open backend engineering](https://boards.greenhouse.io/gitlab/jobs/5495081002) position available if you are interested in applying. Almost 2/3s of the Pipeline Security team has been focused on Verify Reliability initiatives related to [Build Artifacts](/direction/verify/build_artifacts/) and availability. The Pipeline Security team has not been able to execute on the planned direction as a result of this shift in global priorities. The Pipeline Security group is responsible for [6 categories](/direction/verify/#verify-stage-categories): Performance Testing, Usability Testing, Code Testing, Review Apps, Build Artifacts, and Accessibility Testing; of which we have chosen to [not invest](/direction/verify/#what-we-arent-focused-on-now) in some of those categories. We have moved [Code Quality](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/81271) over to Secure to align with the other scanning capabilities. 

In broad strokes, the Pipeline Security group expected to move two categories in Maturity in FY22, but did not accomplish this target. One is Code Quality move to [Viable](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/1392), which recently moved to Secure, and the other was Performance Testing move to [Viable](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/1243). The Pipeline Security Group is also expected to deliver key functionality related to Code Testing including the [Project Quality UI](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5430) to support the Paid GMAU PI for Pipeline Security, and this has been delayed until at least FY23-Q4 as a result of the Verify Reliability efforts. 

In FY23-Q1, the Pipeline Security group will be prioritizing our Verify Reliability efforts. In FY23-Q2 and beyond, we are expecting to focus on [Build Artifacts](/direction/verify/build_artifacts/) and [Review Apps](/direction/verify/review_apps/). We have since pivoted our PI focus from Paid GMAU to a GMAU with the inclusion of Build Artifacts in the Pipeline Security charter and expect to enhance our free user base by improving the management and experience of [artifacts](/direction/verify/build_artifacts/#whats-next--why) in GitLab. With the [Verify Stage](/direction/verify/) persona focus on Sasha and Devon, the Pipeline Security Team will need to explore developer-related JTBDs for testing capabilities in GitLab and prioritize those experiences to deliver on being the leader. 

The Pipeline Security direction has two opportunities for acceleration, first is to increase community contributions for categories like Review Apps which have a strong user following and the second is increasing headcount. There are two proposals for increased investment which include an ask for 3 engineering headcount to add a category for [Shift-Left Testing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/2516), which would keep us competitive in the market from a testing capabilities POV as well as ask for 1 backend engineer to support S1/S2 burndown, especially related to Build Artifacts.  Without the additional investment for Shift-Left Testing, we are unable to compete effectively in the production readiness realm for enterprises. Without the additional headcount for S1/S2 burndown, the Pipeline Security Group will be unable to execute fully on the [Code Testing direction](/direction/verify/code_testing/) and improvements to further enhance Accessibility Testing, Performance Testing, and Review Apps will be delayed until FY24-Q1. 

We appreciate your continued support and engagement in the Verify, Pipeline Security group! 

Thanks for reading, 
Jackie
