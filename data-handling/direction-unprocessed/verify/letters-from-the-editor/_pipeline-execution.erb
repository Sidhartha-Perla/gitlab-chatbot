### Pipeline Execution Letter from the Editor 

To the GitLab Community and customers,

First I want to thank our community for all the community contributions over the 15.6, 15.7 and 15.8 releases. Thank you!

At the beginning of FY-23 the team was focused on [ensuring OSS contributors](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5653) can continue to use the GitLab DevOps platform while mitigating crypto mining abuse. We have made [improvements](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/05/22/gitlab-15-0-released/#display-usage-of-shared-runners-in-user-namespaces) to visibility of compute minutes tracking before we started [counting minutes](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/11/11/public-project-minute-limits/) for all public projects on June 1st and finalizing the [cost factor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/compute_minutes.html#cost-factor) change on October 1st.

As we look ahead to FY-24 we will focus on [Advanced Security and Compliance](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#advanced-security-and-compliance) features like letting project owners [allow trusted external parties](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6546) run pipelines in their projects to solve for use cases like keeping dependencies up to date without manual efforts. Beyond that, we are looking at a broader theme of a [World Class DevOps experience](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#world-class-devops-experience) by helping solve problems users are having with [debugging pipelines](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5022) and the theme of [Advanced Security and compliance](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#advanced-security-and-compliance) by helping solve problems users have with leaked [tokens and secrets in build logs](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8007).

Looking forward if we wanted to accelerate the maturity plans of our categories we may look for more ways to include the wider community for contributions to the core CI functionality. Features such as Running GitLab Pipelines for external SCM, Merge Trains, and pipeline views are key areas to enhance. Activating the community will avoid decreased velocity in feature development while being able to maintain focus on stability and performance of the GitLab platform.

An additional thought experiment is to increase investment in Pipeline Execution by 2-3 backend engineers. This increase would enable us to effectively burn down our bug backlog and accelerate forward-looking technical roadmap items related to the [Pipeline data partitioning design work](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/ci_data_decay/pipeline_partitioning.html#iterations).
