To the GitLab Community and customers,

TL;DR: We will continue maturing our GitOps and overall Kubernetes offering, the [GitLab agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/). 
As part of this direction, we plan to sunset the certificate-based integration in GitLab 17.0 (around May 2024) if we manage to close all [the blocking issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/configure/general/-/issues/199) by mid-2023. 
Together with improving Kubernetes integrations, we want to improve the Kubernetes related delivery tooling of GitLab.

We planned very ambitiously for FY23 and we try to learn from it. We wanted to move the Kubernetes Management category to Complete in Q4. We failed this plan. Our plan for FY24 is to be near Complete maturity by the end of it. 
We realized that providing a mature, production-ready offering requires a much wider scope of features. We want to close this gap and be a mature solution around Q4FY24.

We want to remove the certificate-based Kubernetes integration in 17.0. This requires us to ship several features that [currently block the removal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/configure/general/-/issues/199) and 
to improve the agent for Kubernetes to become a viable alternative for CI/CD and GitOps users as well. We supported the migration of several clusters to the agent in the past year. 
Given these migrations, we think that our CI/CD integration is good-enough and we want to primarily focus on improving the GitOps support of the agent. This would include Helm and Kustomize support and additions to scaling a single agent
to support multiple manifest source repositories, multiple target clusters and more automation around access management to containers and charts within GitLab.

Besides the mentioned core GitOps features, we want to work on some delighters. We are integrating a resource overview into environment pages. Once this integration is ready, we want to build a generic Kubernetes dashboard into GitLab.

For the second half of the year, our plan is to turn our focus towards building out the delivery capabilities of GitLab. We imagine this with a [Deployment management project](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/delivery/deployment_management/#the-deployment-management-project) 
and the [GitLab Delivery framework](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/delivery/deployment_management/#gitlab-delivery). We plan to ship the first few iterations in FY24.

The above focus does not allow us to work on the [Ingrastructure as Code offering](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/iac/). Thankfully, the Package:Package group took over the Terraform module registry and
we have a growing community for the [GitLab Terraform Provider](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/terraform-provider-gitlab/) that we finally managed to migrate to GitLab.
