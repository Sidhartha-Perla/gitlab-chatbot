### What is Verify?

The Verify Stage is responsible for executing on the market needs for continuous integration.

From our Continuous Integration [use case](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/usecase-gtm/ci/#continuous-integration):

_When practicing Continuous Integration, teams collaborate on projects using a shared repository to store, modify, and track frequent changes to their codebase. Developers check in or integrate their code into the repository multiple times daily and rely on automated tests to run in the background. These automated tests verify the changes by checking for potential bugs and security vulnerabilities, as well as performance and code quality degradations. Running tests as early in the software development lifecycle as possible is advantageous to detect problems before they intensify._
