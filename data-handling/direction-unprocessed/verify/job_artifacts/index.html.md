### Introduction and how you can help
Thanks for visiting this category direction page on Job Artifacts in GitLab. This page belongs to the [Verify Stage](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#verify-stage) and is maintained by Rutvik Shah ([E-Mail](mailto:rutshah@gitlab.com)).

This category covers the experiences related to the artifacts generated by a CI/CD pipeline or a job.

For specific information and features related to display of artifact data, check out the [GitLab Features](/features/) and for information about administration of artifacts please reference the Job Artifact [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/job_artifacts.html). You may also be looking for one of the related direction pages from the [Verify Stage](/direction/ops/#verify-stage-categories).

This direction page is a work in progress, and everyone can contribute:

 - Please comment and contribute in the linked [issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?sort=updated_desc&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Category%3AJob%20Artifacts&first_page_size=50) and [epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics?state=opened&page=1&sort=start_date_desc&label_name[]=Category:Job+Artifacts) on this page. Sharing your feedback directly on GitLab.com is the best way to contribute to our strategy and vision.
 - Please share feedback directly via email or on a video call. If you're a GitLab user and have direct knowledge of your need for Build Artifacts, we'd especially love to hear from you!

### Overview
<!-- Describe your category so that someone who is not familar with the market space can understand what the product does. -->
[Job Artifacts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/job_artifacts.html) are created as an output of a pipeline or job. This includes both the jobâ€™s artifacts, job logs and pipeline artifacts. Artifacts can be used for reports that are displayed directly in GitLab or can be published to [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/pages/) or in some other way for users to review. Artifacts can provide a wealth of information to development teams and the users they support.

For information about storing containers or packages or information about release evidence see the [Package Stage direction page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#package-stage).

### Strategy and Themes
 <!--Capture the main problems to be solved in market (themes). Describe how you intend to solve these with GitLab (strategy). Provide enough context that someone unfamiliar with the details of the category can understand what is being discussed. -->

We aim to help users optimize their storage usage from Job Artifacts and build a cohesive pipeline experience with the following capabilities:

* [Improved Artifact Management Experience with API enhancements and UX capabilities](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8715).

* Create a more cohesive pipeline integration experience for complex pipelines such as [Seamless artifact handling for child/parent pipelines](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4019#top).

### 1 year plan
<!--
1 year plan for what we will be working on linked to up-to-date epics. This section will be most similar to a "road-map". Items in this section should be linked to issues or epics that are up to date. Indicate relative priority of initiatives in this section so that the audience understands the sequence in which you intend to work on them.
 -->

We do not have plans to deliver new features for Job Artifacts in the upcoming year. However, Pipeline Execution will continue to support high priority bug fixes for this category. Our team will also support [community contributions](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/) that help advance this category.

The CI Platform group will be working on [creating a retention policy for job logs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/374717) to help users manage storage used by job logs.

<!-- #### What is next for us -->
<!-- This is a 3 month look ahead for the next iteration that you have planned for the category. This section must provide links to issues or to [epics](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#epics-for-a-single-iteration) that are scoped to a single iteration. Please do not link to epics encompass a vision that is a longer horizon and don't lay out an iteration plan. -->

<!-- #### What we are currently working on -->
<!-- Scoped to the current month. This section can contain the items that you choose to highlight on the kickoff call. Only link to issues, not Epics. -->

#### What we recently completed
Over the last 3 milestones our team has delivered the following:

* [Improved a query that caused time outs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/471727) on GitLab 17.3+ releases
* [Fixed a column header issue on the Artifacts page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/497289)

#### What is Not Planned Right Now
<!--  Often it's just as important to talk about what you're not doing as it is to
discuss what you are. This section should include items that people might hope or think
we are working on as part of the category, but aren't, and it should help them understand why that's the case.
Also, thinking through these items can often help you catch something that you should
in fact do. We should limit this to a few items that are at a high enough level so
someone with not a lot of detailed information about the product can understand-->
* **Bulk deletion of build artifacts via API.** We understand this need, though that is not in our immediate plans as we have chosen to prioritize the release of this functionality via UI ([released in GitLab 16.1](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2023/06/22/gitlab-16-1-released/#manage-job-artifacts-through-the-artifacts-page)).
* **Improvements to the Artifacts page.** We thank our users who provided feedback to our team. Due to resource constraints and our current priorities, we are unable to action on these suggestions immediate. [Suggestions have been documented](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11453) and we will resume development in this area once feasible to do so.

#### How to Contribute
Although we do not plan on adding new features this year, we welcome and support [community contributions](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/) that align with our category vision. You can find our list of issues ready for contribution [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?sort=closed_at_desc&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Apipeline%20execution&label_name%5B%5D=Category%3AJob%20Artifacts&label_name%5B%5D=workflow%3A%3Aready%20for%20development&first_page_size=50). If you have an issue that is not on this list, but you feel passionate about it and want to contribute, please tag `@rutshah` in the issue and we will work with you to determine a path forward and connect you with our [community contribution team](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/) to ensure your success.

### Best in Class Landscape
<!-- Blanket description consistent across all pages that clarifies what GitLab means when we say "best in class" -->

<!-- BIC (Best In Class) is an indicator of forecasted near-term market performance based on a combination of factors, including analyst views, market news, and feedback from the sales and product teams. It is critical that we understand where GitLab appears in the BIC landscape.-->

<!-- #### Key Capabilities -->
<!-- For this product area, these are the capabilities a best-in-class solution should provide -->

#### Top Customer Issue(s)

The most popular customer request is for the ability to support the [generation of multiple artifacts per job](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/18744) to reduce the need for pipeline logic to make select files available to later jobs.

Another popular customer request is the ability to [reference child pipelines from the parent pipeline](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/285100). Visibility/Traceability and [seamless artifact handling for parent/child pipelines](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4019) is a recurring usability theme we have heard from our customers.

#### Top Internal Customer Issue(s)

The Gitlab quality team has requested the ability to upload artifacts from a job when it [fails due to a timeout](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/19818) to assist in debugging pipeline failures.

<!-- #### Roadmap
<!-- Key deliverables we're focusing on to build a BIC solution. List the epics by title and link to the epic in GitLab. Minimize additional description here so that the epics can remain the SSOT. This may be duplicative to the 1 year section however for some categories the key deliverables required to become the BIC solution will extend beyond one year and we want to capture all of the gaps. Moreover, the 1 year section may contain work that is not directly related to closing gaps if we are already the BIC or if we are differentiating ourselves.-->


<!-- #### Top [1/2/3] Competitive Solutions

PMs can choose to highlight a primary BIC competitor--or more, if no single clear winner in the category exists; in this section we should indicate: 1. name of competitive product, 2. links to marketing website and documentation, 3. why we view them as the primary BIC competitor -->


<!-- ### Target Audience
List the personas (https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/roles-personas#user-personas) involved in this category.

Look for differences in user's goals or uses that would affect their use of the product. Separate users and customers into different types based on those differences that make a difference.
