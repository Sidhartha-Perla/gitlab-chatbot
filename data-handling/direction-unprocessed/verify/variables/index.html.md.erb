### Introduction and how you can help

Thanks for visiting this category direction page on Variables in GitLab. This page belongs to the [Pipeline Authoring](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#pipeline-authoring-group) group of the Verify stage and is maintained by Dov Hershkovitch ([E-Mail](mailto:<dhershkovitch@gitlab.com>)).

This direction page is a work in progress, and everyone can contribute:

- Please comment and contribute in the linked [issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?sort=updated_desc&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=CI%20variables&first_page_size=20) on this page. Sharing your feedback directly on GitLab.com is the best way to contribute to our strategy and vision.
- Please share feedback directly via email, Twitter, or on a video call. If you're a GitLab user and want to discuss how GitLab can improve Variables, we'd especially love to hear from you.

### Overview

GitLab Variables are a foundational experience for how people build, control, and manage GitLab pipelines. Variables are data values that are can be inflenced by user interactions with a product.

### Maturity Plan

As we work towards making Variables a "Complete" capability, our maturity plan includes the following key milestones:

- [Maturity Plan](#maturity-plan)
- [Issue List](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?sort=updated_desc&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=CI%20variables&first_page_size=20)
- [Overall Vision](/direction/verify/)
- [UX Research](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/14178)
- [Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/)

### Strategy and Themes

Variables in CI/CD pipelines are designed to make pipelines dynamic, configurable, and reusable. They allow developers to parameterize and control the behavior of pipelines without hardcoding values, thereby improving flexibility and maintainability. 
Over time, customers have increasingly used variables to inject parameters into CI templates. While this was not their intended purpose, many customers have adapted to this approach. However, this misuse has led to several problems and challenges, such as reduced clarity, security issues, and difficulty managing pipeline configurations.
To address these issues, we aim to introduce **pipeline inputs** as a more robust and purpose-built mechanism for injecting parameters into CI pipelines. Pipeline inputs will allow for a clearer separation of concerns, better security, and improved usability. Additionally, variables can still be used within inputs where appropriate, ensuring compatibility and flexibility.




### 1 year plan

Our top vision items are: 

- [Hardening variables security](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/15583) (confidential epic) - In this epic we focus on improving the security and privacy of variables to promote a safer developer experience.
- [Support inputs for pipelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/438097) - This epic focuses on prioritizing inputs over prefill variables, as inputs provide broader use cases and better align with the evolving needs of our users. By enhancing inputs, we enable more dynamic pipeline configurations, improve pipeline security, and elevate the overall user experience.

#### What is next for us

In 17.8 onwards, we plan to deliver [variables improvements for pipeline creation performance](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/14348).


#### What we recently completed
<!-- Lookback limited to 3 months. Link to the relevant issues or release post items. -->

In the past three milestones we have released the following Variables improvements: 

1. [Enhanced control over who can override variables](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/06/20/gitlab-17-1-released/#enhanced-control-over-who-can-override-user-defined-variables)
1. [rules:changes:compare_to support to variable expansion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369916)
1. [View the variables entered when running a manual pipeline](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/323097)
1. [Backend: Using variables in rules:exists does not work if the variable contains a `/`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/386595)

#### What is Not Planned Right Now
1. Variable expansion for different keywords  
2. Feature requests for prefill variables 
### Best in Class Landscape
<!-- Blanket description consistent across all pages that clarifies what GitLab means when we say "best in class" -->

BIC (Best In Class) is an indicator of forecasted near-term market performance based on a combination of factors, including analyst views, market news, and feedback from the sales and product teams. It is critical that we understand where GitLab appears in the BIC landscape.

#### Key Capabilities 

Check out our [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/) on Environment Variables.

#### Roadmap

This category is currently at the "Competitive" maturity level, and our next maturity target is "Complete" ([see our definitions of maturity levels](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#maturity). 

#### Top Competitive Solutions

As a foundational CI requirement to major competitive experiences for variables include: 

- GitHub 
- Circle CI
- Octopus Deploy 

### Target Audience

Check out our [CI Section Direction "Who's is it for?"](/direction/ci/#who-is-it-for) for an in depth look at the our target personas across Continuous Integration. For Variables, our "What's Next & Why" are targeting the following personas, as ranked by priority for support: 

1. [Sasha - Software Developer](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/personas/#sasha-software-developer)
1. [Priyanka - Platform Engineer](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)

### Top Internal Customer Issue(s)

Variables are a critical area for our internal users and external customers alike. Internal customers have shared the need for the following issues: 

- [Predefined variables for manual jobs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223739)
- [Support Required Variables](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/289766)
- [Surface the used custom variables for manual jobs and allow to retry the job with updated variables](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/32712)
