When considering which tier new feature belongs, we use two a [buyer-based](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/pricing/#buyer-based-tiering-clarification) and [thematic](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/pricing/#themes) model. 

The former helps us to consider who the feature is for and the latter to consider how the feature fits within the broader GitLab application. If you are interested, consider reading more about the [GitLab pricing strategy](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/pricing/#pricing-strategy).

The below details how we are thinking about each of the tiers and the kinds of features that will be included.

##### Free

The Free version of the product includes the ability to publish, download, and share dependencies using your GitLab credentials. 

We'll focus on usability, reliability, and seamless integrations with GitLab continuous integration and delivery. We will ensure that our product is easy and rewarding to contribute to. We will continue to rely on the GitLab Community to help define and refine our product offering. This includes adding support for new package manager formats. 

Roadmap features targeted for tier:

- [Package Registry user interface improvements](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3693)
- [RubyGems Registry](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3200)
- [Debian Registry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/5835)
- [RPM Registry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/5932)
- [Cleanup policies for the container registry](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2270)
- [Cleanup policies for the package registry](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5152)

The [protected containers](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9825) and [protected packages](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5574) features are noteworthy because they are in the Free tier because they are being added by a Community member. And Based on GitLab's [stewardship handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/stewardship/#contributing-a-not-yet-existing-feature), newly developed features created solely by community contributors will be tiered according to the preference of the creator.

##### Premium

From a buyer perspective, Premium features will be focused on team(s) usage, with the purchasing decision led by one or more Directors. The features in this tier will generally align with the themes

1. Faster code reviews
1. Ops insights

Roadmap features targeted for tier:

- [Maven virtual registry](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/14137)
- [npm virtual registry](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3608)
- [PyPI virtual registry](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3612)
- [NuGet virtual registry](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3611)
- [Virtual registry for any OCI registry](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6061)

But we know that you likely rely on dependencies from a number of remote repositories. That's why we'll be focused on adding support a dependency proxy for for [remote and virtual registries](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2920) and a [generic proxy for container registries](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6061). This set of features will ensure that your team can view and manage all of their dependencies in one central location, making code reviews easier and more efficient.

Once your team(s) are using GitLab to manage dependencies, it's important to understand how those dependencies are being used at your organization. That's where the theme of Ops insights comes in. On the roadmap, we have a feature planned to help you measure and display the number of downloads for dependencies. 

##### Ultimate

Directed toward an executive likely buyer, we will focus our efforts here on serving the needs of our larger, enterprise customers. This means introducing features that align with the themes:

1. Advanced security testing
1. Compliance

Roadmap features targeted for tier:

- [Dependency firewall](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5133)
