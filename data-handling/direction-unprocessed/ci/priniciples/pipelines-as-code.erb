#### Pipelines as Code

[GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) is based on pipelines as code principles and a key competitive advantage against other tools that require manual configuration of pipelines. [Standardizing on common CI/CD pipeline tools has been proven to increase business results](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-at-work-key-lessons-from-industry-digital-leaders#). The [value of defining pipelines as code (i)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HuRjVqH4D8qEuWkhv77XT6PEnnpml2gn/view?usp=sharing) is evident:

* It enables developer control of their pipelines
* It allows versioning of pipeline changes and collaboration on any proposed changes
* It allows for consistency via re-usability of pipelines and jobs across multiple projects

GitLab will continue to lean into our pipelines as code capabilities by adding support for releases, advanced deployments and complex builds directly in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` files. We'll also add more support for sharing common pipeline code across groups to create a consistent CI/CD platform within your organization.
