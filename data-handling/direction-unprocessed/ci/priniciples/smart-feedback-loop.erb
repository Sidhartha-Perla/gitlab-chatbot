### Smart Feedback Loop
Defining your infrastructure, observability, and operations as code is just the first step.
The real magic happens when you rapidly iterate on those definitions.
As a single-application for the entire DevOps lifecycle GitLab completes what is commonly a major gap in the DevOps loop - the feedback from ops back into planning. 

Our vision is to provide not just an easy ability to identify, suggest, complete, and deploy changes to your production system, but also enable new insights that other tools can't.
During incident response, GitLab can quickly identify the last deployed commit, lines of code changed, and author to guide the response to the right place.
During deployment, GitLab can quickly tell you if your production system is already out-of-bounds from defined service-level indicator (SLI) metrics and roll back.
During post-mortems, GitLab can suggest runbook or alert changes.
We are very excited about enabling DevSecOps teams with these smart additions.
