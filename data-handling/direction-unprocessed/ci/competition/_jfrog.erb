### JFrog

JFrog provides a variety of DevOps tools. Although, you likely are more familiar with them as a universal artifact manager. But with their acquisition of Shippable, JFrog added significant CI/CD features to a platform that also includes X-Ray, a set of security and compliance tools, and Distribution for releasing your code.

JFrog markets itself as an "End-to-End DevOps Platform" but they lack many capabilities such as Agile Planning, Version Control, and Monitoring that a DevOps Platform should have. 

If you work for an organization with more than fifty developers, the chances are you are using or have used Artifactory. Artifactory is a universal artifact manager which helps organizations to simplify how your team manages dependencies. Why is that important? Well, most software projects are dependent on many different packages that are downloaded from many different places on the internet. Artifactory simplifies the process by allowing you to use one URL for publishing and downloading all of your dependencies. Without using a tool like this, you would have to rely on each developer to maintain a correct, ordered list of external repositories on their local machines. This works fine when you have a small team, but once you have more than twenty developers it quickly becomes difficult to manage. The risk of not having these files meticulously aligned is that you could end up using incorrect, or worse, dependencies with known vulnerabilities. 

JFrog's X-Ray product offers dependency scanning for catching any known vulnerabilities and a dependency firewall which allows you to prevent them from being downloaded to begin with.
