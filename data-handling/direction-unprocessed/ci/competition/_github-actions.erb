### GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) are an automation workflow integrated with GitHub repositories. Each action is triggered by one or multiple events.
Using GitHub Actions, users can define any number of jobs, including deployment jobs. Microsoft has setup actions to be like lego pieces, and has built a workflow around finding and reusing actions in an [actions marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions). 

GitHub Actions recently introduced [environments](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-12-15-github-actions-environments-environment-protection-rules-and-environment-secrets-beta/) which can help users set specific rules based on environments to automate deployment workflows. Furthermore, environment scoped secrets enables different secrets for different tiers, separating deployment from development to meet compliance and security requirements.
