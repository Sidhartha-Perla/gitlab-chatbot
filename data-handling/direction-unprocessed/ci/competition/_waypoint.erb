### Waypoint

[Waypoint](https://www.waypointproject.io/), by Hashicorp, provides a modern workflow to build, deploy, and release across platforms. Waypoint uses a single configuration file and common workflow to manage and observe deployments across platforms such as Kubernetes, Nomad, EC2, Google Cloud Run, and more. It maps artifacts to runtime after the test and build phases. Waypoint sits alongside the source code, and enables declarative deployment - it takes the manifest of how the platform is configured and will execute the steps sequentially unique for each platform. Waypoint can be used with GitLab CI and even with the Auto DevOps workflow with deployments being done by Waypoint.
