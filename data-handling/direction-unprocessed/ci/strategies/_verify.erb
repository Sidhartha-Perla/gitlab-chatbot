### Verify

To define our top focuses and initiatives, the Verify Stage needs to have a concerted perspective on what GitLab will offer for the
Continuous Integration [use case](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/usecase-gtm/ci/).
We are targeting the [Ops Section Direction personas](/direction/ops/#medium-term-1-2-years) and will support these users with our
Continuous Integration [mission](/direction/verify/#continuous-integration-mission), [vision](/direction/verify/#continuous-integration-vision), and one-year direction.

#### One-year direction

GitLab CI/CD unlocks the DevSecOps workflow. A key focus for the Verify Stage is supporting the automation of secure workflows in GitLab while delivering ease of use across GitLab CI/CD.
Our goal is to be the best-in-class CI/CD platform of choice. To support this goal, we are investing in the following areas next year:

**[World-class DevSecOps experience](/direction/#world-class-devsecops-experience)**
1. Evolve the discoverability and reusability of syntax with the [CI/CD Catalog](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/05/08/ci-cd-catalog-goes-ga-no-more-building-pipelines-from-scratch/)
1. Improve job composability and extensibilty of GitLab CI/CD with [GitLab Steps](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/115359) and [GitLab Events](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8349)
1. Deliver superior build speed by offering expanded machine types and sizes for [GitLab-hosted runners](/direction/verify/hosted_runners/) and improving [pipeline execution speeds](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7290)
1. Release a next-generation container registry with [garbage collection, improved performance](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5521) and a [new UX](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3211)

**[Advanced Security & Compliance](/direction/#advanced-security-and-compliance)**
1. [Full integration with Google Cloud](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/04/09/gitlab-google-cloud-integrations-now-in-public-beta/) with access control using Google Cloud Console for enhanced security

**[Observability & Analytics](/direction/#observability-analytics--feedback)**
1. Better visibility into [runner health](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/421372) with the runner fleet dashboards for [instance administrators](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/runner_fleet_dashboard.html) and [groups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/runner_fleet_dashboard_groups.html).

#### What we aren't focused on now

There are important things we won't work on to focus on our one year plan.

1. **[Code Testing and Coverage](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/verify/code_testing/)** - Our users are looking for improved experiences in Review Apps and Build Artifacts. We are trading off investing in other visualizations and testing capabilities to unlock those features.
1. **[Review Apps](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/verify/review_apps/)** - We are shifting focus on differentiators for GitLab CI/CD related to reusability, security, and speed.
1. **[Build Artifacts](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/verify/build_artifacts/)** - while a critical experience, we will not be investing in any new experiences for Build Artifacts.
