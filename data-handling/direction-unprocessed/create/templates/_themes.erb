### Enterprise Source Code Management

[Source code management (SCM)](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/source-code-management/) is the foundation of an organization's software development practice. SCM tools provide the interface and controls that teams use to define the rules and workflows their developers operate within to write code and collaboratively produce software. At any size of company, it is critical that the SCM tool be intuitive to aid in productivity, streamline collaboration for reviews across teams and functions, ensure compliance, and enable best development and security practices. However, these challenges become more acute and more difficult to solve at the enterprise level. The larger an organization becomes, the greater their communication and coordination overhead is since there are more numerous, bigger, and broadly distributed teams trying to work together. To address this, the industry is adopting DevSecOps practices to increase velocity and reduce cycle time. Selecting an SCM tool is the first step on that journey.

As examples, GitLab will provide:
- Enterprise-grade administration for configuring rules and controls across hundreds of teams
- A library of project templates that allow the bulk creation of repositories
- Different merge strategies to enable teams that work linearly and nonlinearly
- Support for git forking workflows for teams that rely on restricting write access to the official codebase 
- Support for development in monolithic repositories and binary assets for those working in the digital media space 
- Streamlined code review workflows enhanced with automation 
- A remote development platform that enables the onboarding of developers in a single day

### Security built-in, not bolted on

Security is a team sport and organizations benefit the most when the developers have it top of mind. The most successful teams integrate security practices into code reviews and even into the actual writing of code. Source code management platforms typically offer this functionality via integration with multiple other tools, bolted on. This creates context-switching and inefficiencies. SCM tools that offer security testing natively understand how critical a developer’s time and attention span are to producing great software rapidly. By purchasing tools that make the “required tasks” (i.e. approvals, security, compliance) enjoyable and low-effort, companies retain happy development talent while meeting regulations, preventing breaches, and shipping software frequently.

As examples, GitLab will provide:
- Security scan results in the merge request
- Real-time feedback in the Web IDE allowing developer to write secure code prior to code review
- Centralized management of libraries & dependencies via Workspaces to secure the software supply chain

### The Developer Experience

The developer experience is defined by development velocity, safety, and how it enables innovation and iteration. Investing in the Developer Experience therefore drives revenue and reduces risk for organizations. To provide a strong DX, a company must purchase tools that are highly usable & reliable, organized to support the developer journey, reduce context switching, and minimize decision fatigue. Such tools can significantly increase developer productivity by automating the manual repetitive tasks, removing the need for the individual developer to maintain local environments or worry about keeping libraries and dependencies up-to-date, and providing a central internal developer portal for project, process, product, and API documentation with an intuitive and beautiful UI. 

As examples, GitLab will provide:
- Remote development option that enables developers to quickly spin up environments to develop cloud native applications
- A CLI equipped with native tools for the developer, operations, and security personas
- AI assisted suggestions for best practices, performance, & security
- Lightning fast and accurate code search
- Code review workflows that reduce review rounds and that offer intelligent suggestions for appropriate reviewers
- Extensions for GitLab to the tools where developers work
- A robust and easy to use embedded Web IDE
