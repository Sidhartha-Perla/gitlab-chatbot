In three years the Create stage market will:
   - Still be focused on Git as the superior version-control system
   - Evolve [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to efficiently support monorepos and take market in the movie and video game industry from other version control systems
   - Experience enormous performance and accuracy leaps in code search
   - Incoporate ML/AI in every part of the DevSecOps life cycle
   - Embrace cloud-based development environments

As a result, in three years GitLab will:
   - Be the market default tool for [Source Code management](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/create/source_code_management/source_code_management/) in all industries including Entertainment and other sectors that depend upon binary assets
   - [Provide strong support for monorepos](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/773) by extending commands and workflows in git that make working with enourmous repositories fast and efficient
   - Provide a [browser-based IDE](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/create/remote_development/web_ide/) that provides reliable and secure access to pre-configured development environments
   - Provide [cloud-based remote development environments](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/create/remote_development/workspaces/) to improve security and efficiency for development teams during software development
   - Offer more options for developers to do their work completely [within their chose IDEs](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/create/editor_extensions/) without switching context to the GitLab UI through our Editor Extensions.
