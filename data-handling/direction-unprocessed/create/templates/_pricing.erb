The Create stage pricing strategy balances the needs of individual contributors, with the needs of enterprises, to create a cycle where individual contributors gladly and rapidly adopt GitLab, and naturally create the business case for upgrading to a suitable tier, typically Premium and above. The core pillar of the Create stage is the merge request based development workflow. This touches Source Code Management, Code Review and the Web IDE, and is heavily influenced by individual developers, and managers who implement access controls for efficiency, security, quality and compliance purposes. Our investment and pricing philosophy is to:

- Invest in the Free tier to drive adoption by individual contributors like developers and designers
- Drive adoption of Premium from the Free tier by providing more control to managers and administrators
- Retain customers which drives expansion of more users and cross-stage efficiency with Ops, Secure and Govern

### Free

The tier for **individual contributors, personal projects, or small teams trialing GitLab**. Free is important for retaining our core users Developers (SCM, Code Review, Web IDE) and exploring different avenues of expansion in the types of personas who contribute to GitLab and their use cases. Expanding support for different markets and use cases through improved binary file and monolithic repository workflows and more accessible editing tools begins at the individual contributor level, as does supporting new personas like designers and marketers.

Examples:

- [Web IDE](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide)
- [Powerful Branching](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git)
- [Merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/)

### Premium

The tier for **teams**, Premium is enterprise ready and delivers important access controls and workflow controls needed for multiple teams to collaborate on the same large project. The Premium tier features for Source Code Management and Code Review are already mature, and very valuable to medium and large enterprises. Many feature requests and improvements driven by Premium customers are improvements to the experience of individual developers, which facilitates growth through expansion and standardization on GitLab.

Examples:

- [Approval Rules for Code Review](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/rules)
- [CODEOWNERs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/code_owners)
- [Custom group-level project templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/custom_project_templates.html#custom-group-level-project-templates)

### Ultimate

The tier for **Executive buyers with strategic objects for their business**, this tier is primarily supported through Audit and Compliance capabilities that extend project level access control features.

Examples:

- [Security findings integrated in the IDE](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/editor_extensions/visual_studio_code/#view-security-findings)
- [Real-time SAST scanning in the IDE](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/editor_extensions/visual_studio_code/#perform-sast-scanning)
