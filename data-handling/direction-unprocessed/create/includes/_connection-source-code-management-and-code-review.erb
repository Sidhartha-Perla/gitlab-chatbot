### Connection between Source Code Management and Code Review

The Source Code category of GitLab offers the features where the creative process begins. Here authors will not only consume existing project contents but will also author new content that will eventually move through the DevOps lifecycle. Additionally, many of the features in Source Code are consumed in the Code Review stage of the software developement lifecycle. Consider the following examples:

* [Merge request approvals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/) allow project maintainers to define **who** is the most relevant user/group to review a particular portion of the codebase. While this feature is consumed in the Code Review process, it is created and managed in the Source Code Management process.
* [Code owners](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/codeowners/) enable teams to present clear signals around codebase ownership as well as enables project maintainers to ensure subject matter experts are reviewing incoming changes. This feature is created and managed in Source Code, but part of its outputs are consumed in Code Review.

Because of this close relationship, the Source Code Management group must work closely with the [Code Review group](/direction/create/code_review/) in order to ensure the developer experience is cohesive and efficient. This experience is core to providing a great first impression for users.
