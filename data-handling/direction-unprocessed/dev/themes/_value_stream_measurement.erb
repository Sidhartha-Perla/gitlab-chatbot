### Measurement and Increased Efficiency of the Value Stream

Peter Drucker has stated “If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.” Many software development teams have no way of measuring their efficiency, and even if they do, there is not enough feedback, information, or actionable insights to improve the efficiency of their team. Even then, once efficiency is improved, it can be difficult to tell if a team’s performance is good or bad, as there is often no point of comparison. Even the best performing team in an organization could be worse than the competition. Increasing efficiency is paramount to companies increasing their **time to value** and helping organizations answer **“Is my DevOps transformation working?”**

We believe efficiency can be improved in two ways. The first way is to reduce cycle times for existing value stream activities. The second is to question and optimize the value stream into higher value-added activities at each step. GitLab’s vision is to help answer both of these questions: “Am I doing things fast enough?” and “Am I doing the right things?” These two questions are intertwined because the faster an organization can ship, the quicker feedback will come in from users, creating a virtuous cycle of shipping things quickly as well as ensuring the things shipped are the right things.

Today, value stream management is largely focused on visualizing the value chain through deployment. GitLab is uniquely positioned to also visualize, track, and measure value chain activities from the strategic initiative level all the way to captured value from an organization's customer. For example, the value created by post launch activities, such as press releases, blog posts, marketing campaigns, and customer engagement should funnel into value stream management; providing the business with insights and data to continuously improve each step of their value chain.

The market for value stream tools has begun to bifurcate into value stream delivery platforms and value stream management platforms. GitLab can solve for both of the use cases of these markets. In order to become a more successful VSMP platform, we'll need to ensure that we provide support for calculating VSM metrics on 3rd party tools, for example, Jira issues.

As examples, GitLab will provide:

* Easy-to-use and customizable tools that measure the efficiency of the DevOps lifecycle.
* Insight into areas of waste where teams can improve.
* Recommendations based on large data sets of other teams using GitLab for comparison.
* A visual experience for value stream management that goes beyond code deployment.
* Provide VSM flow metric calculations based on 3rd party tools/integrations.
