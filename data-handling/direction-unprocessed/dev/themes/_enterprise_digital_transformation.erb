### Enterprise Compliance

Most enterprise customers have custom requirements that need to be implemented inside of GitLab. Examples of these are controls that spans systems such as permissions, approvals, compliance, governance, workflows, and requirements mapping. It is our belief these needs will exist for many years to come, and we will need to incorporate these to truly become a complete DevOps platform that serves enterprise segments. We will strive to do this in ways that are modern and, where possible, adhere to a [“convention over configuration”](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/#convention-over-configuration) approach.

Additionally, compliance, auditing, and surfacing evidence of security/compliance posture to auditors will become more important as more GDPR-like legislation is enacted and passed into law. GitLab should make it easy to not only surface and deliver evidence for GitLab controls (i.e. who has access to GitLab, who did what on what group, etc.), but also to track and manage compliance requirements for various legislation our customers may be bound to for the applications they create inside of GitLab.

As examples, GitLab will provide:

* Customizable workflows and checkpoints, unlocking enforcement, approvals, and insight into these workflows.
* More customizable and fine-grained permissions.
* Logs for everything that happens within GitLab and allow those events to be accessible via the API and UI.
* Alerting on GitLab audit events.
* Providing a great requirements and quality management experience.
* Deliver chain of custody reporting.
* Provide simple compliance reporting and dashboarding views.
