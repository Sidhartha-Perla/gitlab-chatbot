### DevOps for More Personas

DevOps started with the merging of Development and Operations and has since been augmented to include Security, highlighting DevSecOps as the next trend. There are many other personas that are involved in software development, such as product managers, project managers, product designers, finance, marketing, legal, procurement, etc. These personas will continue to expand until nearly every role at knowledge-work companies touches some facet of the DevOps lifecycle. Over time, organizations will realize that teams who work out of the same platform/set of tools are more efficient and deliver faster business and customer value.

Because of this trend, each persona of the DevOps lifecycle should ultimately be treated as a first-class citizen in GitLab. 

As examples, GitLab will provide:

* A better experience for project management workflows.
* A space for product designers to design and collaborate on designs with product managers and engineers.
* Financial reporting for things like resource allocation, capacity planning, and P & L analysis.
