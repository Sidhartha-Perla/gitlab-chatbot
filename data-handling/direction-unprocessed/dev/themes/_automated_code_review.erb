### Efficient and Automated Code Review

Code review should be a delightful experience for all involved in the process. Over time, we expect the code review process to evolve from where it is today to become a more automated process in the future. Along the way, incremental improvements will occur, where developer platforms like GitLab will focus on performance and usability of the code review tools. Code review should be an efficient process, and the easier GitLab can make code review, the more efficient dev teams become. [Research](https://blog.semmle.com/code-review-metrics/) has shown that better code review should reduce the number of bugs and increase the amount of higher-quality features an organization can ship. The code review process will continue to provide a venue for developers to learn and collaborate together.

As examples, GitLab will:

* Load large, multi-file diffs faster than any other comparable product on the market.
* Provide tailored insights to the code reviewer, alerting them to the most important areas to review.
* Provide ways to reduce the wait time in the code review process.
* Make the experience when browsing multi-file diffs delightful for the code reviewer.
* Provide a code review experience inside of VS Code to help devs stay in flow.
