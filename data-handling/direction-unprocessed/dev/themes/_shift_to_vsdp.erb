### Shift to Value Stream Delivery Platforms From Point Solutions

Instead of maintaining numerous integraitons between point solutions, customers are beginning to realize the value of adopting a platform to solve for their DevOps requirements. These platforms are known as VSDPs, or Value Stream Delivery Platforms. Because GitLab version controls code for our customers, we believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the VSDP market.

As examples, GitLab will provide:

* Focus on usability of cross-stage workflows. For example, Plan->Create, Create->Verify.
* More prominantely highlight metrics that relate to value deliverd to our customers and make these available within groups/projects. For example, lead/cycle time, release velocity, throughput, etc.
* Focus on tying delivery metrics to business value
