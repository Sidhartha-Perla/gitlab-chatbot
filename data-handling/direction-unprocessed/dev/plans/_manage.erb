**1. SaaS First & Enterprise Readiness:** GitLab must be seen as a platform that enterprises can use out of the box for both GitLab.com and self-managed deployments. We're doing this by focusing on improvements in several key areas:
  * Enterprise-grade authentication and authorization. Critical for large organizations managing thousands of users, we're focused on investing in SAML SSO by ensuring that it [works across a range of identity providers](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1900) and automatically manages authorization with [SAML group sync](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/118).
  * [Create a consistent experience](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4257) between self-managed customers and GitLab.com customers by better defining the boundaries of your workspace. Currently, these experiences differ, mainly from the reason that the code base running the two deployment types is the same. This means as a self-managed customer, you have control at the instance level. Conversely, for GitLab.com, the highest level of access is at the group level. 
    * We'll also increase the amount of control that organizations using GitLab.com have over their users without needing GitLab Support to step in. We'll add better forking controls, the ability to manage your users, and differentiate the experience between your work life and your personal projects. Additionally, we'll be giving group admins better controls over settings that were historically only available at the instance.
  * Access management for large organizations. We'll improve [subgroup membership inheritance](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33534) and allow for confidential projects that a subset of a group's users have access to - without automatically granting access to everyone in a parent group.

**3. Providing a great import experience:** Few instances start from scratch - for most, one of the earliest tasks for a GitLab administrator is importing information from outside the application. We'll win by creating easy paths to adopt and fall in love with GitLab:

* Make importing easier at any scale. Especially for large-scale moves, we're prioritizing making the move to GitLab take less time and energy.
  * GitLab-to-GitLab transitions should be especially frictionless. We're going beyond our project import/export capabilities and extending it to [group migration](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2771), making large-scale transitions at the group level straightforward.
  * Prioritize a great experience transitioning from key competitors. We're focused on the user experience when migrating from selected key competitors. Manage is currently prioritizing [GitHub](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2984) while other teams focus on [Jira](/direction/foundations/import_and_integrate/integrations/) and [Jenkins](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/verify/jenkins_importer/).

**4. Actionable analytics:**  We've made great improvements last year by completing Support for all four DORA metrics and making improvements to the Value Stream metrics, which provide better observability into you SDLC lifecycle and help you identify bottle necks and improve productivity. We want to be able to prove the value of GitLab by surfacing usage trends and delivering an [Enterprise DevOps Dashboards](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9317) area where executives and leaders can view usage and metrics for teams and projects that they care about. We'd like to solve for two main problems for executives and leaders: tracking GitLab's ROI and helping find centers of excellence.
