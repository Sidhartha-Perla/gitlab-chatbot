The Application Security Testing (AST) stage helps customers find vulnerabilities in applications before they reach production.
We focus on developing scanning capabilities to find these vulnerabilities, then we work closely with the [Security Risk Management](../security_risk_management/) and [Software Supply Chain Security](../software_supply_chain_security/) stages to ensure that organizations can take action on the vulnerabilities our scanners detect.

> GitLab was named as a [Challenger in the 2022 Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing](https://page.gitlab.com/resources-report-gartner-magic-quadrant-ast-2023.html).
