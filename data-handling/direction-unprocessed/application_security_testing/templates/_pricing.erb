Application Security Testing pricing and tiering reflects GitLab's overall [pricing model](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/pricing/).

##### Ultimate

We focus our efforts primarily on Ultimate.
Advanced security is [an Ultimate pricing theme](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/pricing/#ultimate) and helps customers deliver on organization-wide security and compliance priorities.

Advanced features, including technology developed in-house at GitLab and technology we've [acquired](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/acquisitions/), are available only in Ultimate.

##### Free and Premium

We make a subset of our AST scanners available in all tiers (including Free).
We typically do this when the scanners are themselves open-source.

We do not specifically focus on Premium.
