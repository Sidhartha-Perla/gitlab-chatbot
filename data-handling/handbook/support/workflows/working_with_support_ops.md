## Working with Support Ops

### Ticket where customer is asking for support portal changes

Occasionally, a customer might mis-file a ticket and send a request for support portal changes using a Support form. In these cases, please change the form to `Support Ops` in Zendesk and Customer Support Operations will handle it from there. Please do not send a public reply (as that removes our SLA clock from the ticket).

### Asking general questions

For general questions and assistance, reach out via the [support_operations Slack channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C018ZGZAMPD). From there, a member of the Customer Support Operations team will respond and work with you to help address the question.
