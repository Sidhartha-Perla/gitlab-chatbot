## Overview

This page contains details regarding workflows specific to the [GitLab for Startups](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/startups/join/) program.
Please see the [Community Programs Workflows page](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/community-programs/community-programs-workflows/) for complete details on the program's application process.

Currently, only VC- or accelerator-backed startups are eligibile for the program.
Startups are not eligible for the program if they have been paying GitLab customers within one calendar year.

We categorize their approval offering by two different funding qualifications:

- Seed Stage: Less than $5 million USD in funding
- Early Stage: Greater than $5 million but less than $20 million USD

Startups must submit proof of association with a VC or accelerator fund, along with current funding status.
The easiest way to obtain this information is a Crunchbase, PitchBook, or Y Combinator profile link, which should be submitted upon application.

## Startup Program Service Desk

- We use issue Boards in GitLab service Desk to manage the Startups Program **applications** and **support**.
- If you are looking to check the status or file a question with the Startups Program please do so via the Startups Program Issue Board below.
- [Startups Program Issue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/developer-relations/startups-program/startups-program-support/-/boards)

For reasons relating to trade controls, we are unable to accept applicants from Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, Russia, Belarus, or Ukraine.

## Legal agreement

GitLab for Startups Program members are subject to the same terms and conditions as regular GitLab customers, since this program only grants them 12 months of GitLab Ultimate for free.
When the promotion period ends, startups will have the option of becoming regular paid customers.
