## How to Reach Us

For quick questions that **do not** require legal advice, deliverables, or any discussion of confidential information, you can reach out to LACA in Slack at [#legal](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/legal). We find this channel best for questions about process, who handles what, or how to find certain things if the handbook has not yielded the right result for you after searching. #legal is not a private channel, so your inquiry will be visible to the entire company. One of our team members will do their best to answer your question in a timely fashion.

Most questions regarding specific customers require a legal case in Salesforce. Follow the process [here](/handbook/legal/customer-negotiations/#how-to-reach-the-legal-commercial-team) to open one.

For other questions related to deliverables and non-sensitive information, create an issue in the [Legal and Compliance project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/legal-and-compliance/-/issues). Be sure to use the template most suited to your request to engage the right team members.

For sensitive, private, or confidential matters, email [legal_internal@gitlab.com](mailto:legal_internal@gitlab.com).

## Anonymous Internal Ethics and Compliance Reporting

We take employee concerns very seriously and encourage all GitLab team members to report any ethics and/or compliance violations by using [EthicsPoint](https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/74686/index.html). Further details can be found in the [People Group Handbook](/handbook/people-group/) under [How to Report Violations](/handbook/people-group/#how-to-report-violations) and in our [Code of Business Conduct and Ethics](/handbook/legal/gitlab-code-of-business-conduct-and-ethics/).

## GitLab Policies

See [GitLab’s Ethics and Compliance Program](/handbook/legal/ethics-compliance-program/#compliance-standards-guidelines--other-resources) for a list of policies, compliance standards, guidelines, and other resources.

## Authorization Matrix

The [Authorization Matrix](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/company/authorization-matrix/) designates who is authorized to sign legal documents. Only GitLab team members with signature authority can execute agreements on behalf of GitLab.

## Non-Disclosure Agreements

Follow the [non-disclosure agreement process](/handbook/legal/nda/) to learn how to send an NDA (note there’s a separate process for [non-standard NDAs](/handbook/legal/nda/#non-standard-nda-requests)).

## NAVEX Compliance Courses

For information about compliance training, including new hire requirements, and tips for using the NAVEXEngage platform, see [here](/handbook/legal/legalops/navex/).

## Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Requests

{{% details summary="What is a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request?" %}}
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) provides public access to all United States federal agency records except for those records (or portions of those records) that are protected from disclosure by any of [nine exemptions or three exclusions](https://www.dhs.gov/foia-exemptions) (reasons for which an agency may withhold records from a requester). Occasionally the records of a federal agency under a FOIA request may include GitLab records in the possession of the agency (i.e., when the agency is a customer of GitLab). In such an event, the federal agency will notify GitLab of the FOIA request and provide GitLab with the documents that the federal agency intends to release in response to the FOIA request. A GitLab legal team member will review the list and content of the documents identified by the federal agency pursuant to the FOIA request and will provide the appropriate response and/or make redactions to those documents, as necessary, prior to their release.

In the event you receive a notification from a US federal agency pursuant to a FOIA request, indicating that GitLab documents or information have been identified for release by an agency, please immediately forward the request to <FOIA@gitlab.com>.
