## Congratulations

You have completed the initial setup process for your GitLab account and MacBook. If you encounter any issues, please contact the IT Help Desk.

### Apple ID

- Please create a new Apple ID for GitLab using your @gitLab.com email address to keep your personal and work data separate. You can also reimburse apps using an Apple ID created with your GitLab account. Your Apple ID consists of an email address and a password. It's the account you use for everything you do with Appleâ€”including using the App Store, Apple TV app, Apple Book Store, iCloud, Messages, and more.

### Optional Setup Items

- **Screen Time:** Monitor and get reports on the use of your computer. For options and details, see Screen Time on Mac.

- **Enable Siri and "Hey Siri"**: You can turn on Siri and "Hey Siri" (so you can speak your Siri requests) during setup. To enable "Hey Siri," speak several Siri commands when prompted. To learn how to turn on Siri and "Hey Siri" later and for information about using Siri on your Mac, see Siri on your Mac.

- **Store files in iCloud**: iCloud has the ability to store desktop and documents in iCloud. As our Cloud Storage option is Google Drive, please make sure this feature is disabled. Anything of importance for work should be stored in Google Drive, a GitLab Issue, or the Handbook based on the type and [data classification](/handbook/security/data-classification-standard/) of the information.

Apple has official training sessions available every week! These training sessions are great if you are new to using a MacBook or want some tips and insider knowledge on using a MacBook! Please check it out [here](https://events.apple.com/content/events/pst/us/en/default.html?token=xww6uj7woR0X9A3Y9qIMRkNVdH60MurN7MAvJSY75sHQxWqaTEhMjEmalXqC7MMJuZhb5dzJ1P9mLUXaAAfCMipX6qVTaNqFY_njjpamZQfrSbMYEpe-edwBN1r5nI4t-GCxEY8&a=1&l=e).

## Laptop Setup: Linux

Check out [this detailed page](/handbook/tools-and-tips/linux/) on setting up your Linux laptop. Also feel free to reach out in #Linux slack channel or #it_help for assistance!

## Extra Setup

### Endpoint Management

MacBook: You are required to install Jamf on your MacBook for security and compliance reasons. Please check [this guide](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/it/endpoint-tools/jamf/#enrolling-in-jamf) for assistance!

Linux: Currently we do not have an endpoint management tool for Linux. However we do have [a tool](/handbook/it/end-user-services/onboarding-access-requests/#fleet-intelligence--remote-lockwipe) that we use to wipe and lock them if needed.

### Laptop Encryption

It is essential to encrypt your laptops hard drive using Mac's FileVault or Linux's built in encryption. This will prevent unauthorised access of the contents in your hard drive. Please refer to our security pages to complete this.
