## Overview

The AI Abstraction Layer category is focused on build the [AI Architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/gitlab_duo/index.html) within GitLab's enterprise infrastructure.

## Goals

The AI Abstraction Layer aims to:

1. Standardize and abstract common needs including performance, cost monitoring, health status, access controls, telemetry, interfaces, developer tools, and APIs.
2. Scale, maintain, support production support for the AI/ML technologies abstracted behind the AI Architecture.
3. Build initial engineering implementations of AI/ML technologies abstracted behind the AI Architecture.
4. Support for all GitLab distributions: GitLab.com, Dedicated and self-hosted customers.

## Extensibility

The tooling and AI Architecture the AI Abstraction Layer supports will enable extensibility of AI/ML technologies for users of GitLab including the wider open source community. While we will prioritize needs within GitLab, we aim to make it easier to integrate other new AI/ML technologies with GitLab in a structured and scalable way. We encourage and welcome community contributions extending the AI Abstraction Layer and AI Architecture.
