## Mission

Deliver an easy, informed, and reliable experience for customers to purchase GitLab products, manage their subscriptions, and view billing details and contacts.

## Overview

The Subscription Management team is responsible for providing customers with the self-service tools and features needed to purchase GitLab products and efficiently manage their subscriptions and accounts.

### Key focus areas

1. Empower customers to purchase new products and make changes to their subscriptions without requiring assistance from GitLab support or sales teams.
1. Automate subscription management with features like Quarterly Subscription Reconciliation (QSR) and Auto-Renewal to streamline processes for customers and internal teams.
1. Continuously improve the [Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/) to ensure a seamless and intuitive experience for all user types, including self-service, sales-assisted, and channel partner customers.
1. Given the global commerce functionality, support compliance, legal, and tax related efforts to safeguard revenue and meet regulations.

By focusing on these areas, the Subscription Management team aims to reduce friction in the subscription lifecycle, improve customer satisfaction, and support GitLab's overall growth and retention goals.

### Target audience and experience

- Self-service customers
- Sales assisted customers
- Channel Partner customers
- Internal teams (Sales, Customer Success, Billing, Legal, Tax, Compliance)

## Roadmap and Planning

### Current opportunities

| Opportunity | Solution(s) |
|---------|:--------|
| Customers often struggle to identify the appropriate contact for assistance with purchasing or managing their subscription and billing account. | We plan to [create a "Contact Us" page](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/14927) where customers can view their Account Executive's contact information and direct links to reach support. |
| Customers would like the ability to add extra subscription contacts to their accounts without contacting Support. | We plan to [enable customers to invite multiple billing account managers to the Billing Account](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10495). |
| Customers who purchased GitLab through the sales team would like the option to pay their outstanding invoices using a credit card. | We plan to [build a "Pay for Invoice" page to enable one-time payments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/work_items/10399). |
| Customers in India are unable to make direct purchases from GitLab due to the [Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mandate](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12051&Mode=0). | [We plan to address this problem](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/16220). |

### Next opportunities

| Opportunity | Solution(s) |
|---------|:--------|
| Customers often find Upcoming Renewal emails confusing, as they tend to be irrelevant, unclear, and lacking actionable information. | [Move subscription renewal emails out of Zuora and into CustomersDot](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9303). This will allow us to limit which emails are sent, and customize their contents. |
| Purchase flows in the Customers Portal lack a consistent user experience and scalable technical implementation. The process for buying Premium or Ultimate differs significantly from purchasing products like Storage or Compute, as well as from upgrading or renewing. This inconsistency increases the engineering team's workload in building and maintaining these various flows. | We are working to [unify all purchase flows in the Customers Portal to enhance scalability and improve the user experience](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/12199). |

### Future opportunities

| Opportunity | Solution(s) |
|---------|:--------|
| A subscription set to auto-renew may fail to renew for several reasons: expired credit card, payment failure, unpaid overages, or issues calculating overages. | Analyze data on the number of subscriptions that failed to auto-renew and develop a tactical plan to increase the success rate of auto-renewals. |
| Approximately 5% of our customers are associated with multiple billing accounts, but the Customers Portal currently does not support this scenario. | [Create an experience](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8986) that allows customers to view and switch between multiple billing accounts seamlessly. |
