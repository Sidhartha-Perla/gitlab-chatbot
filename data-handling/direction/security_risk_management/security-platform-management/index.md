## Overview

Security Platform Management is a group in the Security Risk Management stage.  We enable AppSec and development teams to orchestrate and control their application security tools from within the GitLab platform and integrate seamlessly with external tools.  We provide a frictionless, holistic operational experience across our suite of security offerings.  There are three categories in the group and details on the direction of those categories can be viewed on the following pages:

1. [Security Testing Configuration](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/security_risk_management/security-platform-management/security-testing-configuration/)
2. [Security Asset Inventories](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/security_risk_management/security-platform-management/security-asset-inventories/)
3. [Security Testing Integrations](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/security_risk_management/security-platform-management/security-testing-integrations/)
