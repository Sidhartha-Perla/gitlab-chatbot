## Overview

The future is mobile. Based on an [estimated 6.7 billion smartphone subscriptions worldwide and a global population of around 7.4 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/203734/global-smartphone-penetration-per-capita-since-2005/), the global smartphone penetration rate was estimated at 69 percent in 2023, up from 2022. Companies, especially those in B2C industries, must continue to invest in mobile software development.

Today the two main mobile application platforms are iOS and Android. Each platform has its own unique features, processes, opportunities, and challenges. Both platforms are rapidly evolving, which means that development teams must keep up with the rapid pace of innovation, and they expect their partners to do the same.

## Strategy and Themes 

Our vision for GitLab Mobile DevOps is a close-to-zero maintenance overhead solution for GitLab SaaS or Self-Managed that provides an organization's mobile app development teams with the ability to easily automate the building, testing, distribution, and securing of mobile applications for iOS and Android using their chosen frameworks, tools, and processes.

We will achieve this vision by creating automation and tooling to enable developers to create a golden path mobile application CI/CD pipeline with only a few clicks. Developers can then expand those capabilities by adding additional integrations and security tools.

## 1 year plan

Previously, the GitLab Mobile DevOps product strategy was led by a single engineer, which enabled us to quickly explore and develop an initial set of capabilities for GitLab Mobile DevOps. The Mobile Dev Ops stage is now under the Verify section. As a result, we are creating a multi-year roadmap that builds on the current capabilities and delivers the stated vision. 

In calendar year 2025 we plan to work on the following

- [x] Update the [Mobile DevOps documentation](/direction/mobile/mobile-devops/).
- [ ] Update example mobile app development project templates to include the latest technologies and best practices.
- [ ] Create new video tutorials.
- [ ] Create new golden path workflows for Mobile DevOps on GitLab.
