## Tenant Scale Section

The Tenant Scale section is responsible for the features and tools our customers use to operate GitLab at scale. We offer regional scalability, multi-tenant operations for GitLab.com, and the ability for top level organizational management.

The Tenant Scale section is made up of three groups:

* [Geo](/direction/geo) - Disaster recovery and worldwide performance
* [Organizations](/direction/organizations) - Delivering top level management for customer instances
* [Cells Infrastructure](/direction/cells-infrastructure) - Delivering a scalable multi-tenant framework to scale GitLab's SaaS offerings.

### Mission

> GitLab can be easily scaled to meet the demands of the users.

Tenant Scale provides a framework which allows GitLab to scale in order to meet the business demands of our customers. We enable both multi- and single-tenant GitLab platforms to be easy to administer, easy to migrate, and easy to grow to meet demands. Our focus is on ensuring that, no matter which GitLab offering (self-managed, Dedicated, GitLab.com) is being used, native and intuitive tooling exists which allows for scaling and configuring the instance.

We're aiming for a world where a self-managed customer can easily create a geographical dissimilar secondary site from within GitLab, where a GitLab.com customer can migrate seamlessly to our Dedicated offering, and where organizations can create an instance in a specific region. While we may not yet be able to do these things, we're working towards them with a clear vision and focus.
