## Overview
Secret Detection is a group in the Application Security Testing stage. To learn more about this group, please take a look at the direction [Secret Detection](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/application_security_testing/secret-detection/secret-detection/) page.

## Purpose
This page is for high-level prioritization of the Secret Detection team for 17.0-17.11. It primarily includes feature/product items and is not a comprehensive list of everything that will be worked on such as bugs, implementation issues, documentation, or technical debt. It is not intended as a replacement or alternative for our issue boards. It is meant as an easily consumable single view of the main in-progress and upcoming work items for the Secret Detection group. It also allows mixing Epics and Issues in a single list.  The tables come from the [secret_detection.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/product_priorities/secret_detection.yml) file.
This list is not a guarantee of timing or order of delivery. Rather, use this as a guide to see the top items we are working on and will be in the near future. The list purposefully does not extend out beyond a year to minimize a false sense of priority.
